I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
They didn't really make any difference.
hope i helped !
this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.
i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).
 So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...
 Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.
the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
I'm not a big audiophile, but I have no objections to how it sounds.
I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.
Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes.
The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk.
I still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and it's still working flawlessly.
reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
5 .
  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off:
 The I-Pod certainly helps me with my music and I can take it anywhere with me.
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.
do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'.
It was worth the wait.
structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
They were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?).
sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways.
The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
1 Speakers at home,I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.
i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.
 the packing inside was in tatters.
It DOES take some getting used to.
so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.
sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well.
honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
the zen has no stop button .
 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were " ? " s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.
despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
The hardcase they give with it must work well.
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.
could not stop it , could not get out of the " now playing " screen .
it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
enjoy !
Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.
we 'll see if i need them to .
that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is " sold out " or more likely " discontinued " at the almighty amazon.com ?
creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + .
 Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.
I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.
the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
but the earbuds suck !
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.
While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer).
 After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
The player was large and bulky.
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
 2.
I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.
While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch.
it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.
The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid.
Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
It seems like the software is just not responding.
 The player is great.
  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity.
Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored.
After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
i can do that myself .
Alot of people seem to compare any music player to an Ipod.
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .
THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
 The Creative player sounds a bit better, but not anything to worry about.
I popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up.
his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .
NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
The Zen offered a great alternative.
The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.
The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.
-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
i am very pleased so far .
* slick-looking design and improved interface
what kind of a company does that !
You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.
it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why .
it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
Creative says that the software engine for this MP3 is the best hands down.
only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
 I am so in love with this thing I can hardly stand it.
otherwise feedback seems to be good .
first let me give you the bad things :
4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.
loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
on my main computer the software did not work right .
 Pros Holds a ton of music.
rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
You will also need to download and install new firmware on the player.
now i know better .
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
take the time to fill in those tags !
So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
the sound quality is very good .
I have gone through two of them in two years. .
All in all, this is a wonderful device.
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
 You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.
they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out .
typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
They're better than the IPOD, plus, there are seven EQ settings (including custom).
Why isn't it?
in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was " the man " and wo n't believe i returned it .
nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
Some upgrades are needed for the Micro to work properly with the Windows XP operating system and Media Player 10.
I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
PS.
and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .
I'm also somewhat of an audiophile.
the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
it says i have a harddisk problem .
player controls :
I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .
if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .
first there 's the unit itself .
The blue backlight is pretty cool.
it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.
With WMP10, you don't need to install any software other than the driver, which makes using multiple computers fairly simple.
Weak Points: - Touch Pad: design could be better - Volume Control: controlled through the vertical strip, but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick.
my only significant complaint is sound quality .
yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
third , the poor design continues with the case .
Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.
I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available.
  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
that was n't pretty .
It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead	 If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.
if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
and then it breaks .
Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.
This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.
This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.
i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
All this before I found out the bad news.
Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).
if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
 It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod.
they fall in love with the product .
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.
Still has terrible software.
and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
1 ) price / gb of storage
I have an ipod and it is a great buy.
 It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.
I don't care what ELSE it can do.
The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.
I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, "I WANT THAT ONE!" I was willing to shell out
a great buy .
 To see a great little short film about this, go to ipodsdirtysecret.com
It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1.
so i 'm screwed .
 Still my favorite MP3 player	 Is it overpriced ?
veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .
They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
 i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.
bummer as it has great sound quality .
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
i 've compared and compared and compared .
a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.
i didnt touch the product.
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to.
I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.
although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
- included creative software is pretty poor .
The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
advertising pays off i guess .. .
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
 While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.
The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
 Is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks.
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.
boy was i wrong .
it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
11 .
for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .
All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.
What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord?
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
Amazing.
Unfortunately I was wrong.
2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
you have to add them to the playing list .
Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.
It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.
I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.
oh ... one more thing .
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
this is all i have to say .
people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.
I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.
also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding.
I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.
features that would have been nice :
i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
6.
navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .
Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files.
Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
With the latest version (10), I can simply browse my WMP library, adding songs/albums/artists to the sync list, and then sync all of the tracks at any time.
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
-doesn't like to be charged via USB on non windows PCs or PCs that don't have the Zen Micro driver installed.
my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
 The first one I received skipped songs randomly.
it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
Overall I have no complaints, this is jus!
Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
also the ipod has games on it .
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.
While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.
I just discovered another con in my list of pros and cons.
However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro.
 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
do n't buy this thing .
Very Pleased.
the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .
i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
Pressed play and I was off.

it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.
ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
But it; you won't regret it.
The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player.
minor gripe .
this is not a player you can take jogging .
Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
3 .
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
for me , that was the only drawback .
The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
storage :
Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.
  At first I primarily used it as a stand-alone portable player but it wasn't until I decided to take it in my car and use it to play back music that I truly adored this device.
- The battery life leaves a lot to be desired.
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
so far the software for the pc works easily .
Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works.
 Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once).
Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.
minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
 However, with the iPod you cannot.
- The FM Radio.
if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .
  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.
 You must buy some sort of protective case unless you want your ipod to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it.
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
In stores, the Micro doesn't even come with the AC adapter.
At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
point the " media sniffer " to your music files and let it do the rest .
I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.
These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.
However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.
sheesh ! !
after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.
the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
size - bigger than the ipod
  I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes.
I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.
Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.
i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
cons :
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
no difference .
 Hence, the one star rating...
At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.
after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
do n't buy this player .
I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.
- the software that came with it was tough to load .
second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
 It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.
- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
out the bulletin boards.
( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )
  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.
 The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
This brings my review to one star!
this thing is trash .
I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing.
The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used.
simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
creative software stinks .
What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
enjoy .
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
 I am a total iPod addict.
if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.
There are bulletin boards and customer reviews all over the web talking about it.
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .
I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.
White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for.
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.
Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
it 's worth it .
 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
4.
the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
What device would I recommend?
