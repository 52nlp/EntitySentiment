Not nearly as good as the original camera, even though it is digital technology
It would be quicker to set my preference
Highly recommended
I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
Couple of nice features
It is a complete piece of s***
To get some decent pictures from our vacation I order the Disney photos, which could have paid for a new camera
10 great price for all the features .
There is even the (very useful) option of a slower continuous shot mode
So far, it is the most impressive camera I've owned
-Yes the power on button is small, but i can always get it turned on even when i have tactical gloves on
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
I'm really enjoying having a camera so small and lightweight
This is also the reason that I haven't explored all the features of the camera
What I saw were very clear/crisp photos which appeared to be somewhat on par with my Panasonic FZ70
I'm totally impressed with this Lumix
Long battery life for still shots, short battery life for video
It's not working for me at all when I got the camera it was a picture on it I think someone returned it I need a full refund I can't even contact the seller
The camera in general has good performance in the speed area, although burst performance has only improved marginally over its predecessor
The camera starts up quickly and has almost no lag at all
or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
Not even an average picture in the lot - everything comes out stunning - beautiful color, sharp images with a perfect focus
love, love, love this point and shoot camera
The camera is everything if not more than I expected, the quality is tops
I bought this camera for shooting video, the lens and quality are great, the price was perfect for what I needed
It turns out that if you preorder you must call them if the price changes
But now my pics have gone from sufficient to nearly artistic
I haven't tried video yet
Sample photos will soon be available on our web site: [
The L830 meets my needs
nikon coolpix S8100
The self timer and smile timer are great when you want a family shot without having to ask people to take your picture
I found both AF and low light performance very good
Bought this camera for many reasons and so far it's great
and Panasonic delivered
The last digital camera I purchased was 10 years ago
I am very pleased with this purchase
negatives ?
For the price, this camera is excellent and I recommend it, just don't expect it to be perfect in all areas and take pics like a high end camera
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3
A tilt screenwould help,but this is a common problem
if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .
1) It is perhaps too small.
I've had this camera for three years.
I've had enough of those tiny compact cameras now and I'm never going back
2) I did not realize soon enough that this camera does not have the option to take black/white pictures or much less sepia, or any other tones
I don't mind the fact that it doesn't have a view finder seeing as I haven't used one in many years
I added on another zoom lens that attaches right to the front of the existing lense, with no adapters or anything needed, and now I have over 100X zoom on a compact digital camera
Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
This is a replacement of one just like it someone dropped while trying to take our picture
I had read the reviews for this camera on several websites and the only negative thing I read about was the zoom sound in videos
Results from scene modes may not give the desired results
I don't know what the deal is but it makes me want to try a different manufacturer next time
You cannot compare a high-end semi-pro camera with a point and shoot camera with a fixed zoom lens
I had an older FZ model years ago that I loved and am excited about this one
the same FW50 battery is also used on the A37/A33 and others in the Alpha line
Does anyone else have a problem with edges
You simply cannot beat the value of this camera and lens combination for the money
The LCD screen is horrible quality as well
The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
If you currently shoot DSLRs, this is a good camera for when you want something light and simple to pack along with you rather than bringing all your gear
The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the film is not readily available
I would like to also have a instant picture camera but after trying out this one, I think I'm done trying to search for another one
i cancelled the order .
Even Duracells are only durable for 300-500 shots
The same problem appeared with the replacement after a few months
We have 2 yr old Grandson who enjoys having his picture made as much an any 2 yr old
8 in low light
With the price it is selling for on Amazon, I should buy another one
I t has the perfect size and all the functions for a family camera, and in a affordable price
Great Alternative To My DSLR
But if your main concern is still images, the S8100 is unparalleled
I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.
In good light and low light the things a champ.
I do miss having a panorama option, but I find I tend to do a movie in those cases anyway
I am still learning how to use it so I will have to give it a little more time
I want to take classes and become a better photographer
Many shots looked like badly done art filters in Photoshop rather than photographs from a moderately expensive bridge camera
5- Excelent software package.
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 has meet all the promises
It is a good product and we are enjoying using it
for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
I spent a considerable amount of time looking for a camera that I needed for a special use
less than a year, so many issues OMG really? I have had cheapos from walmart lasting 20 years, I also own $2000 cameras and never an issue, btw they are canon's, but wanted a small light weight camera and nikon was suppose to be good
especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
It's a nice camera
I found the photos to be about equal to those of my 10yr old $50 Cannon pocket camera
The pictures come out a bit fuzzy and the focus is how steady your hands are
AUTO video does a pretty decent job - there is a slight auto-focus noise as the camera focuses during video
This one has a real professional grip that just fits your hand perfectly
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
So I called the Panasonic support folks and they were essentially worthless and suggested sending the camera back
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
Simple to use, exceptional pictures, crystal clear LCD screen, fits in your pocket, wide zoom range, and long battery life
Battery life is too short and the battery has to be in the camera for it to recharge
need the speed
I have always had Canon's for a pocket sized camera but really thought this one was it
A bit bulky with simple menu options
I believe that was due to my inexperience with the camera
It prints a photo in less than a minute and the quality is exellent
Other than that, I'm very happy with it
Defective piece
The older models were like this
but it does make it a worthy consideration if you are shopping on a tight budget
I can get it to reclose by taking the battery out and in, saying voodoo and sometimes, out of desperation, pushing the lens physically
Coolpix L830 camera
Wish it had the adjustable viewer screen but I knew that before I purchased it
5fps; 1080 video limited to 60i/24p; and there are fewer control buttons so you have to rely more on menus to get to the various settings
(3) Flash performance is relatively poor, especially in contrast to everything else about this camera
The manual could be better
I like the ability of just buying AA batteries and not being tied down to a lithium battery pack
i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
As as all-around mega-zoom, the similarly priced Canon SX-50 puts it to shame in IQ, image stabilization, better scene modes, a better (articulated) LCD, Zoom Assist / Zoom Framing Assist Lock, much better factory software, and so forth
Excellent purchase

Dropping cameras is bad
It was worth every penny
I'm not asking for metal material at this price but it could at least be made from just better plastic
The Digic 4 processor is a fabulous processor and I loved it in my t3
Great pics and easy to use
And it's okay as viewfinders go
Defective video recording: uses too much battery
some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).
This is not a SLR camera
The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
I did a lot of research before deciding to purchase this camera
I did a lot of research before I bought it
User manual is not printed, it is on a cd which is a bit of an inconvenience but saves trees :)
Best digital camera I've owned so far
It's everything it promises
Awesome camera
Since I loved the quality of photos of the S8000, I thought the S8100 might have better quality besides some upgrades tot eh focal plane, better dark performance, etc
This camera is AMAZING, my friends have other kind of cameras and all of them said that my camera is amazing and has a great quality
1 MP sounds fantastic
I shoot primarily JPEGs and have never been happy with the JPEG output of the NEX-6
i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
I don't do any video, so can't comment on that
We go riding in the desert in a side by side and this is perfect for that - small and stowable, but takes wonderful distance shots of the beautiful desert vistas
Looking forward to micro photos and other features
This is an awesome camera for the money
But so far I am unable to get really clear shots at the full zoom length
A side note for the camera it does not work with SDXC cards, I tried my 64GB card and it would not register it, but a 16GB card works great
however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
Two problems
I did my research before I bought my first long zoom camera
If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.
The zoom and focus are relatively quick and quiet
To add insult to injury the software the camera comes with does not offer that either
Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
All things considered I would definitely recommend this camera
The Cannon was OK but lacked some of the items of interest
Nice camera
First of all, the exterior fit, finish, and feel inspire immediate confidence, as the materials used and weightiness of the device exude quality
This is the second Nikon camera i bought in the past 6 months
I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a simple camera
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .
The main downfall I have and the reason for an average rating is because the booklet show a port for a remote but the camera does not have one
The only good thing about the flash is that it cycles very quickly
With an optional adaptor, A-mounts may also be used
I do not plan on using the video feature, other than perhaps on a rare occasion, as I bought it to carry around in inclement weather more than anything, rather than expose the D90 or the D300s to winters elements
It has an articulating LCD screen and the LCD screen has more pixels I really recommend it over this camera and it's even cheaper
. lens cap is a really annoying
This Nikon S8100 is great camera and does great 1080P videos in every aspect except for 2:1) the FLASH photos shots are almost ALL overexposed and look HORRIBLE
I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
I received this camera for Christmas and love it
What a great little camera
5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
Today, I am sending to repair shop - lens will not retract
This camera does almost everything I want in a new camera
1 no direct firewire to the camera .
i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
Also I wanted to point out the OIS is amazing
As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
I added a 50SX about a year ago to have the larger 50 zoom
The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.
Best camera I have ever owned
It's small, digital and you can decide which pictures you want to print, which is awesome in case you take a bad picture
I am surprised others have not mentioned this, though perhaps I received a defective unit
This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
Love it
This is for my daughters birthday
. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
Majority of pictures were blurry no matter what I tried
I love this camera
FlyBoy Seal of Approval
I like everything about this camera except one thing
And well is a Nikon, the shots are extremely crisp and clear, very easy to use, specially in the auto mode
One of the features I love about this camera is all the special effects you can shoot pictures with
so be sure to check it out I think the T3i is the camera to get at the present time
If you really need to move up to a DSLR style camera, I would recommend moving to one of the higher end Sony cameras with a REAL viewfinder
when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better
Result is vibrant picture
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
and i'm glad i did!
Very good with its focus
I don't think it's wise to provide so many shooting modes while it does not have a touch screen
I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
Very easy to use
If you do a lot of video, the T5i would be better
Love It
Excited to use this as my side arm
A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
FREAKING AWESOME ZOOM
Unacceptable Reliability
Love it
broke after 2 months
the picturers are amazing .
for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
one thing puzzles me is that for " fine and 2200 + " quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
12-1-10:  The S8001 has a defect in the firmware
had it for a week .
I think I should have went with a 8Gig SanDisk Ultra PLUS  that had a faster transfer rate
Which reminds me, I think some of the negative comments about the FZ70, in terms of sharpness, may just have been due to an erroneous setting on the mode dial
I have been taking the best pictures EVER since I got this camera
This is a cool camera
- confusing screen display
I heard a lot of great reviews, and decided to buy it
I also didn't like that the flash is manual
This camera is really sturdy and well made
Very very nice pics, the "auto modes" work great
Get Camera even comes with a rechargeable battery which is semi charged
it has dozens of modes to shoot under
the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an " outlet environment " .
It has average shooting performance, slower than other cameras in the Panasonic line, not at all blazing fast
I've always loved taking pictures and this camera is so easy to use and takes great pictures
HD video OK, quality of images better than waited, it's a great camera, good size, good value
This camera has all of the features that I was looking for
WOW
huge plus
With a real viewfinder, you can accurately frame up a picture in all outdoor and indoor conditions
I did not expect a zoom camera has such good image
The reflective ambient light of the western horizon afterglow was picked up reflected on Cathedral Rock using the high painterly HDR effect and it looked like 4 in the afternoon
Good-quality stereo microphones facing the subject being recorded
So listen to all these other reviewers who actually know something about cameras, but as a complete idiot when it comes to this stuff, this camera is great
I am very pleased with this camera
My Canon has spoiled me because that battery lasts forever
After going to 4 stores, comparing cameras and prices, I decided to go on Amazon
Shooting in RAW format is great and works well
On my old Fujifilm S700, the flash auto popped up when needed
For normal viewing, the images look fine and should print fine
this is my first digital camera .
When I received my camera I was so excited
Also, you need  a VERY steady hand when shooting
Fairly good camera for the price
The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
So I am stuck with it now
i bought the fujifilm instax mini 7s for a third of the price and i'm much happier
Intelligent Contrast system to retain shadow detail in high contrast scenes
Highly recommend
I also had a hard time getting the flash to work to fill in backlighting, etc
crystal clear photos
But it was quick and easy
I have been a fan of the Panasonic Lumix Cameras for years
Sony A3000 Super Value
I have a friend who purchased this and she is a semi professional photographer
It could use a vari-angle lens, but that's about my only suggestion at this point
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
it works)
I think that the design of this camera (aesthetic looks) was a great choice
Very disaapointed
battery life is ok .
Auto Scene works OK so far otherwise
the camera was a marvel .
The NEX 7 is a must have
Love this camera
Sound quality is clear, but there is no means of making any adjustments to the volume or turning off the AGC
great job canon !
Items to consider are: 1) the flash seems to be a problem since I normall locate one finger over the location of the flash
This camera is easy to use
I have had no problems with that at all
For now I am taking pictures using the LCD screen
com, these are the A3000's key features:20
this is going to be a long process
I put a 128MB CF card in it.
I bought what I needed to be able to take pictures when I had to, but now I have a camera to take pictures because I want to
Very versatile  with the super zoom
Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
Amazing quality and so easy to use
It is hard to take pictures in bright sunlight, because the LCD is hard to see in bright light
Nice clear picture and great zoom capabilities
Most DSLR cameras do not have this feature; you need to twist the zoom lens itself, which cannot be done smoothly throughout its zooming range
Great camera
The flash works beautifully, the red eye feature is good, the pictures are very sharp and clear
I guess after 65 years of using viewfinder cameras, I just did not adjust to having to look at the monitor
On very close up shots, we have experienced almost too much light
For my long overseas travel, the GPS function is actually essential
I really enjoy taking pictures but I am far from an accomplished photographer
On the other hand, I took a video of approximately 8 minutes in duration with the Vivitar 1700 mAh batteries without seeing a low battery warning, although the camera got pretty hot in the process
It's been a great purchase
Well worth the money
I was excited to get a 20 mp camera, thinking it would be even better than my Sony 8 mp 150, but it does not even come close in quality pictures or ease of use
your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
Easy to set up and use
I bought this camera 7 days ago
My biggest problem was the printing
I had been using an SLR from a competitor, and decided that it was too much for me to learn
I bought a camera the day i left the States to come out here, and it didnt even last 2 days
Polaroid Z2300 10MP Digital Instant Print Camera (White)
I kid you not, I was able to get framable, clear, up close shots of a bald eagle that was sitting in a tree about a quarter mile away
The EVF-LCD switch is manual because there is no eye sensor
Bought it as a gift
One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
Overall, though, has the best pictures so far in a compact camera with good zoom as of May 2014
Maybe you can't teach an old dog new tricks
Movies, panoramic shots, close-ups and portraits are all wonderful
It also takes 720p video which is always nice
It is definitely better than other high-end cameras that I have owned
It is easy to use
I ended up using photoshop and picasa to edit the pictures to try and make it look "professional" something I didnt expect to do by purchasing this camera
The camera exceeded my expectations
I did pull several pics off my computer and loaded them on an Sd card for printing
I love this camera
People who drive think nothing of motoring over to the nearest photo store to get their camera's specialty brand specific sometimes even model specific battery
Battery life = about a day's worth of off and on use while on a recent vacation
Can't get it shipped
It doesn't help that the couple of online &#34;reviews&#34; of this camera say that it DOES have an orientation sensor, nor does it help that Sony's website doesn't say anything about it at all
-The flash assembly seems frail I am very happy with this camera and I highly recommend it
I have had it for three weeks now and I am still finding new features
for an amateur like me, it is very easy to handle
Easy to use
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
We enjoy the 8100, we had an 8000 and it was great also
The continuous shooting mode is as fast as they describe, but the flaw is that it doesn't work like other cameras
I need someone's help with this camera when I do shots at a basketball game I'm not sure of all the settings yet, can someone help I took a lot of pictures (outdoors ) but need help inside
I Love My Nikon
That is, until it started saying "Mode dial is not in the proper position
maybe because it is all plastic
yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
Beyond the flickering, I felt the camera simply took poor photos compared to other cameras I have had, even those with 1/4 to 1/2 the resolution of this one
Designing the pop up flash on the left side of the camera you're the user tends to hold the camera, does not quite make sense to me; however, this was not a deal breaker to purchasing this camera
The simulated analog wheel is confusing to understand, and occupies a far bigger proportion of the display than it should - it blocks out the very subject that one is trying to photograph
I am testing more features every day and will update this post with what I find
Highly recommended.
Love it
The controls were poor and very simplistic
A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture).
Very thin and light
I can't return it because I am leaving for the Grand Canyon next week and will not have time
I have not been disappointed
It even comes with a metal mount 18-55mm OSS kit lens and a hood (Hello Canikon
Thus, the one star as there isn't a zero star rating
What a GREAT camera for 98% of all my camera needs
The obvious reason for getting the DMC-FZ70 is for it's amazing 60x optical zoom
I've had many cameras and this is by far the ABSOLUTE WORST implementation of continuous shooting I have ever seen
It takes great shots, photo printouts are excellent quality for my wife who is an artist
Taking the battery out as to try reset it didn't work
it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
Great camera
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
For years I only used my pocket Sony Cyber - shot
You can't go wrong
I can barely turn on the TV anymore
Autofocus performance is pretty good although it's essentially the same AF system as before
30X stabilization and pic quality are not perfect but pretty good
i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
Since it came from Amazon, every aspect of the purchase came off without a hitch
ever
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
For sub $300, I think it's a great value
a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
Love the T/W lens, the scene choices, etc
the only thin I wish was different would be a battery pack instead of 4 AA batteries
I have to say, I feel this camera is one of the best value purchases I've ever made
just stunning, jaw dropping HDR effects and hand held and easily done
Video quality is as good as I have seen for such a small device
no biggies
This is the best camera have ever had
However this review is about the camera and it is a good camera for a beginner or a travel camera
I love it
I highly recommend this camera
i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
Nikon L830 DOES NOT HAVE ANY ZOOM NOISE WHILE FILMING A VIDEO
I have had it about 40 days and am still in love with it
Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
The clarity and detail of the pictures are so much better than the point and shoot cameras I have previously owned
The features are mind-blowing
I did a ton of research on the camera and it's close relative out there the Canon PowerShot SX510 HS
Don't expect it to be more than that
The functionality was great but that's not the most important aspect of a camera, photo quality is and I just wasn't happy enough with the results and returned the camera
And the kit 18-55 is surprisingly very sharp
( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
Therefore, the pictures I took with this camera were kind of just point, shoot and pray
I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
Easy to use  Small to carry on everywhere
The zoom is remarkable, but after you use the camera for a while you find out some wonderful things that are not really talked about
Nice Camera
the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
Very reasonably priced
would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
The camera is light and has a great sensor, but it's a pain to shoot
Excellent Product
The Rebel line of Canons has produced some incredible cameras such as the T3
The real deal is when you look at the pictures, when you send them to print
I also like the fact it has a HDMI port
That food in the camera and after four shots, it said the card was full
make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
A sign of a good camera is its capability to take pictures in the dark
Yes, it is still relatively small compared to other cameras, but I guess I'm just used to my old Nikon camera that could be easily accessible at moments notice
anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
But I truly was blown away by this camera
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
does a great job at so little price
the image quality is excellent .
But, the product was intact, brand new and with all other packaging items
The tech seem surprised when I told her nothing happened
Once in a while I'll get a winner but more often than not, they look washed out
I am amazed with its zoom capability
An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
I could be at fault on not understanding how to use the burst feature, but not with the poor quality of the zoom
Would buy again
A nice add on in the print menu
I have a DSLR and I have a pocket camera
It feels and looks very solid and well built
Just a quick example: Last week during the full &#34;blood moon&#34; we had a great view of it here in California
The 60x zoom is fantastic for wildlife, and the image stabilization system works very well
Easy to use
If you play around with the settings a little bit you find out what works best
The blood moon effect was awesome
Does lots and has great zoom
I write this review with mixed feelings
Great for scrap-booking
All I have to do is point the camera at the picture I want and click
The sharpness even at full zoom is great and the noise level isn't bad at all
I also discovered the automatic backlit scene sensing and exposure system when I moved to the fully automatic setting - very effective
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .

I find the ability to swivel the screen on my Canon camera extremely useful (high shots, low shots, etc
My main issue with it is, however, the inability to connect to my computer to transport the files quickly
Low light is still a bit of a problem
Gee, thanks for wasting my time
It fits in her purse and she loves the quality
I bought  this camera for the convenience of the video, but has been a dissapointment so far, I have sent it twice for repair (for me is a defect of this model, but check it out before you buy)
flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
Easy to use
So, over all, best compact camera I've seen
They also have the ability to take video
Great performance in exteriors and landscapes
I highly recommend it
Plus the zoom is smooth and is great when trying to bring in that wildlife that is far off in the distance
One of the magazine writers commented about the viewfinder not being exact enough (pixel count) but I had no problems whatsoever
Even when I kept the ISO from climbing above 200 and held the camera reasonably steady, low-light pics were usually fairly grainy and/or blurred somewhat due to motion
We will be traveling from AZ to AK and we'll see how the animal pics turn out
I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
It has a great zoom as long as there is not fast movement
Well, this Lumix definitely outperformed my Coolpix
This takes amazing quality photos on auto mode, has lots of settings
Poor Quality Control, Lousy Customer Service
These features are nice to have but really not necessary features for the beginner or someone like myself with other cameras0
What a great and useful feature
It almost makes the video useless
We shall see come Friday night when I use it at my sons football game
Panasonic stands out as an superb camera
The camera has no major quirks or malfunctions, it just works
audio on video also lacking .
For under $200, I think it's a great value
Doesn't feel real sturdy so I am still taking my older indestructible Kodak camera along in the rough places we ride which kind of defeats the purpose of replacing it
Excellent
in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
So far, so good
If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.
awesome
If you are all about heavy, insanely expensive GEAR, buy an SLR
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
The LCD should be used.
Was just out in Colorado for 2 weeks and took lots of pictures
After thousands of photos, it is ready for retirement
I purchased this awesome camera a little over a year & a half ago and it is by far the best digital camera I have purchased by far
It weighed 2 pounds but had a beautiful lens
I'm still very happy with it
I am not a photographer so the point and shoot works great for me
Great little camera
Other than that, it takes great photos and is easy to use
The big problem is that the app drains the battery of my Samsung S3 Mini in a few hours
