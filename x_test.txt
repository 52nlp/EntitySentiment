fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
On the other hand, when wide-open, the new lens provides slightly better aperture
i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
Took 45 minutes of video and camera was still going strong
Battery has lasted well over 200 pics in a variety of conditions (flash/no flash) but i am still ordered a backup for those long days of photographing things and people and stuff
Hand held sometimes zooming up to 16 or 18x and the shots came out crystal clear
8) As for "plenty of options", a cheap FUJI cam had more options than this thing
Best camera ever
The lack of resolution and clarity in the viewfinder causes you to lose one of the main motivators for going to a camera like this from a pocket model
This camera far exceeds my expectations
Delighted with this product
Heavy emphasis on connectivity options using wireless, canon online services, NFC, direct print to canon printers
Then, only a few months later, it just stopped working
Great camera, until it stopped working
But it would be better priced at around $50 -- not almost $200
11) Garbage autofocus in video mode, I think pressing the take a photo button brings it in to focus though, sorry I forgot the name of that thing, strange, I know
Am having a ball with it
The pics come out beautiful but you may need to reshoot sometimes due to flash overexposure or blurriness in low light (pretty standard with these mega zoom compacts)
00 from Amazon- lens cover  & neck strap are good  quality- on-screen details help when using function dial- transfer  cable & software included- sharp photos with crisp colors- the impressive zoom feature works smoothlyCONS:- Only one
And it's annoying to have to push a button to toggle between the two
This camera is amazing
I love this camera
The flash quality is such that I am not going to complain about where it's located
Fits a man's hand better
It cannot overcome dim lighting
Not small and thats a good thing
I was looking for a camera that would take great photos and video, it has exceeded my expectations for both of these requirements
Easy to use, great pictures
great portable camera w/ awesome video
It is a camera for starters but it can't be compare even with an old Canon EOS T1i
Pictures were prone to blurring, I would say this has the least effective optical image stabilization of any point-and-shoot I've owned
and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
It is a little larger than our old SD700 IS but fits in the pocket and takes better night pictures
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
I priced it at other stores, and Amazon beat them by $100
when doing work where the object isn't so "flighty" (
But just using the camera like I did with my old Panasonic, pushing the capture button down halfway until I see the green image box, I got some pretty good pictures
I do wish it had an articulating screen, remote shutter socket, larger buffer, but you can't have everything at this price
This camera is awesome
My frustration was in uploading the images
Same goes for "night landscape" mode
My fujifilm S8200 had terrible zoom noise
But the best I can give this camera is 3 stars
the glue simply didnt hold
But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
Most of them came out to be unsatisfactory
I have never used a Panasonic camera before and I really like the looks and the high quality feel of this
- The noise level in dark conditions is just NOT acceptable
Solid build like a mini-SLR
I have used the Nikon S8100 for 3 months
I also shot a few images at the horse show under the shade of trees and even in iA mode letting the camera pick all the settings and not zooming in at all, images were dark, mottled and grainy
As a realtor I was having trouble getting good photos of small rooms and this camera has made things those photos much easier to take
Insert sd card and choose the prints you want to print
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
I bought this as a carry around
I know it won't be a Nikon
The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
I had purchased the sx280 for a family member to use on a trip to Europe
Fool proof.
I wish Sony had just skipped the EVF and made the camera with slightly higher resolution screen, at least 460K
The shutter button didn't work
Problem continued; contacted Nikon at about day 110
So we bought the s830
The 30 optical lens is awesome with an option of as high as 120 digital zoom
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
The only thing is when we ask other people to take pictures of our family for us, the pop up flash can be hard if people don't know about it/aren't used to it
the video quality of the camera is excellent, but all of my photos using the flash are overexposed
But I am sure I will love using it
If you are looking for a good general camera with great optics, look no further
;  A few firmware fixes will make this camera shine
I really cannot explain my level of awe from this camera
What else can I say?
I really like this camera - for the price it's a good value
$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
Nikon Coolpix S8100 Don't lend it out
MSRP was $299, Sale was $269 and Got it from Walmart for $229, I think she quoted me the wrong price over the phone and had to get a manager override to give me the quoted $229
This camera is currently offered at a deeply discounted price (so if you if are considering it and see it for less than $300
Overall, a wonderful camera with excellent quality photos, great zoom, good size, CMOS chip allows for awesome night shots (for better visibility only
This is a great camera
Happy with photos -- noted bright, deep colors
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
Throw away the magnetic case
I kept going back and reading directions and trying different settings
It's all the fun of a polaroid with the benefits of digital
You really have to check out the creative shot feature
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
It comes out darker and blurrier
And I was not using a tripod or anything else
Cool idea but bad execution
easy to use
When my wife returns I will be able to give an update response so stay tuned
Deleting images is even slow
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
Amazing quality
And 120x digital zoom
None of these is a show-stopper for me, and there is indeed a lot to like, but I can't call this the best camera ever made
The tilt out screen is a nice feature that I did not know I wanted until I had it
Currently, it can't be beat
Nice camera for the money
i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
After extensive testing with some of the different settings I can tell you the camera exceeds in many areas
Have been disappointed with this camera
Unless you love lugging around a full sized DSLR, this camera will perform 90%+ of what you want while still fitting in a large pants pocket or purse with a simplified user interface and fast startup for quick shots
after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
This camera is in every way awesome
Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
The image quality is also really quite good and the lens, while a bit tight on the focus ring, seems very nice and solidly built
mts HD format
I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
So easy to use
I have purchased 4 of the former and 2 of the latter as I am coming to the painful conclusion that Panasonic has abandoned the high-quality image business
i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
The pop up flash hasn't been a problem for me, but I can see how it would irritate some people
I'm very impressed with the battery life, the display indicates I have full battery life remaining even after all that use
The zoom was amazing
20% more coverage
I knew we would not be close so the high power zoom is what made me choose this model
Also it uses the same memory cards and battery that the DMC-FZ40 did
Good Camera - Still Learning Features
The LCD is crisp and clear but is mounted flush
Great Point & Shoot Camera
Yes it has a flash and it uses it
There was NOTHING at all the least bit loose on my new Nikon Coolpix L830
Every single thing it does is a mini miracle
after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
She never reads the instruction manuals for any of our electronics, but picked it up and started using it day 1 w/o issue
and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
5cm (1 in)
I had to buy an extra memory stick but it's worth it
The only place I could find this camera was on Amazon
1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
The recent DIGIC6 processor with a new advanced Noise Reduction algorithm
this is a wonderful camera .
Purchased this camera to take pictures and video of my son graduating boot camp
yes , i recommend it over the competition .
ONE FABULOUS PHOTO TAKER
I am just glad I can have a compact camera that takes next to SLR pictures
Saves carring a lot of gear
First Rule in a Gun Fight, Have One
I've sent two back so far - any recommendations on the best bag for the S8100 are welcome
EVF used here is useless 99% times anyway
i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
It doesn't give any info as to what the different scenes should be used for
I really love this camera because of the zoom
I actually find it annoying, but got used to it quickly (now I just don't spin it all)
Beware of SD card compatibility
I don't mind the cheap plastic
I can throw this in my backpack and take it anywhere
a little confusing, but I'm sure reading the electronic manual and using the camera over time will make it easier
I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
I need to find some time and just learn how it works
based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
Disappointment
I went at Radio City Music Hall, in NYC, watching Madagascar Live, and I sat in the 3r floor, so far than stage, I put the zoom and I could see the face (all the details in their face) of the people and with my own eyes I couldn`t
In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
Great for newbies
(And that was the narrowed part)The Olympus had all the right specs
It meets my needs
Once I got it, everything went great for the remainder of the trip
My biggest problem with the camera is that I can't find a camera pouch to suit it
This camera comes with wifi transfer of photos, have not set it up yet so can't speak to that at this point
It's also great for taking flashless pictures inside somewhere like an art gallery
The hot shoe design is not perfect
I ordered this camera about 6 months ago
Overall gives good value for pric range
Big 3
they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
There was also noise coming from the camera when in zoom
It is a bit on the heavy, bulky side but I don't mind it much
I thought I would like the extra zoom on the FZ70
More than I expected for a SLR cheap camera
Excelent price,
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
And it records full 1080p HD video
heck even SONY doesn't sell such full featured cameras like this themselves but this one huge exception
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
All the controls are well placed
Its novelty is great and if all else fails, you got a nice camera for family outings and the likes
after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
But really no complaints for the price I paid($279)
I pre-ordered and have found it to be just perfect
As with photos, the low-light performance is impressive too
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
I do not see that many pixels on the photos, it is so frustrating
actually, I like the L830 more
Normally I don't give items a one-star review, but this one has earned it
i do n't think i was asking too much .
The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.
If for no other reason, this camera gets 5 stars for the zoom
It was great, got some wonderful pictures on the oppisite side of the parade grounds
The picture quality is sharp and crisp and my friends think it's the coolest thing ever since sliced bread
i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
Basicaly made in China junk
I also got some out of focus pictures because I was fiddling around trying to use that focus button
That's like all my other cameras EVER, and its a 10x zoom, not 3x or 4x) So, video  works  good when you compare zoom distance to light collection
If you just want to point and shoot you can always use the automatic settings which produce fantastic pictures
Finally, a camera comes along made for people like me
The price is pretty reasonable and thank good the paper is much cheaper then the vintage polaroids
Pictures with flash are especially poor
Takes great pictures
first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
My camera focus's by itself
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
It's cheap and great for beginning photography
Not having a view finder sucks, but I shoot with a nice Nikon and that's all I use
Understand the majority of reviews are done by well meaning rookie photographers
Opening the battery door is a real beast until you get the hang of it
The finish of the camera has a nice tactile feel to it, and the next strap, while not high end, is comfortable enough
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
It takes a 55mm filter size
They do not automatically credit your account
I've had this camera for about two months now, and so far I would NOT recommend it
Very clear
Remarkable low-light performance
I would like to recommend this camera to my friends
Rebels ROCK: T5 vs T5i
A very good design and build quality with the attractive finish
I can find it by feel now
Outdoors, full zoom is marvelous
It's RIGHT where your finger goes for how you would naturally hold a camera-It's really heavy for a camera, so it's difficult to just throw it in a clutch or carry it around-It's oddly shaped, and I was never able to find a camera case for itThe good:-When you do manage to get a good shot, it's a REALLY good shot-It's great outdoors-The zoom is amazingOverall, I would not recommend this camera
however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
Great, great, great idea
it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
However, so far I am very happy using the new camera
i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
I wouldnot suggest the Nikon Coolpix L830 for guys with massive or even large hands since everything is tightly packed onto the camera
A horse and buggy it's not
I ordered this camera and accessories on the 1st and chose the free shipping because the camera was shown as "in stock" at Amazon
( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
It is light
the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
Post dawn, full light shots of surfers looked like Pointilization art
perhaps there is a way around this delay .
Flash is good and fairly powerful for a small unit, exposure mostly about right
The zoom on it is great and zooms in very clear
Uses the Sony &#34;E&#34; mount which makes the full line of their &#34;E&#34; lenses useable on the camera
This camera was supposed to replace my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 10 mp with an 18X optical zoom which has been a great camera
While I have not had a chance to try out the camera very much, my impression is that it feels like cheap plastic, the viewfinder is tiny and grainy and the eyeglass correction lens frequently gets out of adjustment
This is a beautiful, compact and feature loaded camera
Very little shutter lag, comparable or better than other good digitals I've owned (Canon A710, 1100is)
Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
It's a must have for our 10 top essentials for throwing amazing outdoor parties
When I share pics with my friends on Facebook they always want to know what kind of camera I used
First, if your expectations are reasonable, I think most will be happy with this camera
We just had a baby and wanted a good camera to capture memories, and we made the right choice
Used almost exclusively for nature photography, ranging from close ups of insects to distance shots of birds
I went out and bought a SanDisk card and the camera finally accepted it without error
My daughters and their friends liked the photos with colorful borders
it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
I would advise anyone who intends to use this outdoors, or who doesn't have rock-steady hands when shooting without a tripod, to look elsewhere
No ink, digital images better than expected, decent low lighting shots
easy to use
I tested it by taking a flash-free picture of my kitchen at night with all of the lights in the house off
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
so buy the g3 .
It has no major flaws and can be counted to operate reliably every time
upgraded from an PowerShot SX260
Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
Convenient, easy to carry, good photos
There are so many features, it can be difficult to figure out the one you want to use on the fly
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
When in manual focus mode, the viewfinder digitally zooms in to make it easier to find focus
Fairly Ordinary Camera
short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
In the photo, you can actually see the oven and refrigerator and even read the clock on the oven and microwave
I always purchase a Panasonic Lumix camera because I really like the ones I have purchased in the past but the FZ70 has a few changes from my FZ50 that I can't say I care for
i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
great camera
very easy to operate
5 for " digital film " it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
While I mainly bought this camera for its photo capabilities, there is no denying that this little guy makes fantastic videos
It feels like a high end camera and doesn't have that cheap plastic feel
Very happy with this camera
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
It does not provide you that option on the menu and it does not have
Well worth the buy
everything else about the camera is great .
Much easier to use than my old film-version Nikon of technology from the ancient past
(almost)
and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
I put the camera on a tripod, set the zoom to 100x and waited
I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
It's easy to use and gives you little tips about different tools
Others are good
When I opened the box I was initially shocked by how small the camera was
I had two Nikon DSLR's in the past, and they were just very complicated and very heavy for me to use all the time, this is fairly lightweight, and takes stunning photos
It's basically packaging a mirrorless camera into a small SLR sized body
Works perfect as you ould expect
I too would have to agree it is annoying and I often forget to move my fingers as I am not quite used to its location
Panasonic has been making these things forever, so they really have that down pat
I put it on par even with the Canon T5i
Although I've had this camera since November, I had not been able to use it
I couldnt have purchased a better one
I love that you can tilt the screen, it came in handy so many times
But I found a charger with a car adapter and a 2nd Nikon battery for only $26 here on Amazon so that takes care of that
if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
All is good with this camera except for the usb, battery and hdmi outlets
While reviewing the camera prior to purchase, I noted other people mentioned the placement of the flash
Nikon S8100, I love it
Amazing zoom
so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
Neither of us cared for the necessity of charging the battery in the camera and preferred an immediately replaceable battery but it turns out most better quality cameras are of this species so we bought an extra batt to solve that issue
I am disappointed though that FZ70 doesn't have capability and or plug in for external remote, although the zoom is excellent and you can get close enough to actually see the surface of the moon and or zoom in distant object or birds as they were at your hand reach
In other words, all of those pictures were taken without my ever needing to think about or adjust my camera
Never buy a point and click Nikon again
I take a lot of pictures of my granddaughter and she's moving
Looking at the photos on the computer, quality is great
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
We used this on our trip to San Antonio and Corpus Christi and were not disappointed in the quality of the pictures taken by it
Of course, a tripod is great if you can use one along with the timer (since there is no remote release)
Used at our daughters graduation outdoors
here were my requirements in a digital camera :
System reboot after system reboot held no change, and even trying fresh on a second computer had the same issues
We received the product and within 1 month it was already broken
Zoom is great, but be advised camera shake is multiplied when you have it on maximum zoom, so if you plan on taking lots of long distance shots I would invest in a tripod or monopod
$400 bucks for 3 months of use is sad
It was nice
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
Although I have a few minor issues with the camera, I still gave it 5 stars because the number of features that are built into this body and the X60 zoom are just remarkable
After hours of research I had high hopes for this camera
They should INSIST in their literature that you must use their short list of 4 SD cards
It doesnt have any manual controls so if you are looking for pro features this isnt for you
i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
I purchased this for my wife, its really the first "better" camera we have owned
I've read where some were having problems with blurry pictures
Software Defect
I love this camera
Very handy when you just want to take a quick video without having to switch modes on the camera
The weight is simply not a concern to us as we've both carried it around all day without any problems or side effects
The pictures are sharp, extremely clear
I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
these are the reasons i think it 's great :
I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
This has become my go-to for quick pictures, even though I have some more capable cameras available
What I love about the product is that you can take photos, store them on memory (internal or an SD card) and then print on-demand
going back to canon
I am a rank Amateur and don't pretend to KNOW everything about cameras but I do know what I like and don't like
I can also attach a wide angle lens for panoramic shots
a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
Very nice zoom, now I can get decent pictures of my child's sports events from the sidelines
great camera , great investment !
It would be better have a slower FPS that sits and shoots 1 frame/second (like my old cannon p&s;) but a least you can hold it down for an entire sports sequence and hopefully get some of the action
bucks in my opinion
Just get out there and take pictures
It is almost impossible to achieve zooming distant object without a tripod that is, if you want clear picture or movie without distortion but this isn't a camera's fault
Service, and quality sucked
The pictures look better on the computer than they do on the screen
If you do not really need all that zoom, the sx280 may be a better way to go
We ordered this as a gift for our son's graduation
Really great camera
So far I love the quality of the pictures
LOVE MY NIKON
Fortunately, I have had the good luck to travel with photographers, leaving me free to spend time looking
this is somewhat of a neutral thing because some people love them and others hate them
At the time of this review, the FZ70 is also $100 cheaper than the Canon SX50, which certainly played into my purchasing decision
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ ABOUT THE FLASH
I'm not crazy about Nikon not supplying a battery charger, instead you charge the battery in the camera with the usb cord
I've never used a View FInder so I don't miss that
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
It's really fun to take pictures with
First Nikon S8100 camera had a defective lens and was replaced by Amazon
A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
Of course this happened right after the warranty expired, and Nikon's website said they could fix it for a price
Performance is exceptional compared to my earlier point-and-shoot (although the sensor size is identical), daylight pics are great, and the low-light problems that I was experiencing with the older S230 have disappeared
For me it was not worthwhile due to two simple factors
I'm a Cannon man back in the day but Nikon has won me over
For $300 you'd think that the camera would last longer
I waited for the next Panasonic, even while other powerful zooms made their appearance, because I had a hunch it would be worthwhile to do so
There's very little geometric distortion or chromatic aberration
This matters quite a bit for panoramas
what task do they perform ?
Selling for well under 300 dollars elsewhere,I don't care if you have a 2,000 to 7,000 dollar camera, you should have one of these feather weight gems in your bag as well
The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 has more features than I need
nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
3rd Canon SX series with lens or lens cover hang ups
Attractive and nicely finished, plus the weight and heft in general is perfect for me as it lets me know I have something in my hand that I can control
5 x 11, and the printed pictures came out extremely clear
Besides, the thing that matters is the output
This camera is excellent
I'll let you know how things go for me
If there is a lot of ambient noise, and you're careful about this, you won't notice
Happy, happy, happy with my Lumix FZ70
I have been an amateur photographer for 35 or so years
After reading the reviews on several different sites and looking at ratings, this camera is well worth the money
I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
Com but I felt the need to express how amazing this camera is
got way too many blurry pictures .
poor quality
I thought the picture would come out at lot better
Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
Camera takes very nice photos
the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
Although this camera is bigger than I wanted, I already have a Canon, I love the quality of the photos, color, sharpness
This is one thing that a DSLR can't hope to do without an expensive lens just for it
It is obviously not a compact camera to accommodate the powerful zoom lens
When I press the shutter button to take a picture, the flash resets and recharges, but there is no flash light
Nikon coolpix
9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
The menus also offer a great set of tips to help new users understand even the more advanced features
1 MP- 60x optical zoom (it's true)- Accepts SD, SDHC and SDXC (just added a 64GB SDXC and it flies)- Rechargeable battery, AC charger, wrist strap and semi-proprietary USB data cable included- Small and light when compared to a full DSLR- Photo in all the formats you'd expect including 360-degree panoramic and 3D and with various preset settings, too many to mention in a brief review- Supports JPEG (DCF/Exif 2
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
Pictures are crystal clear; camera is small and compact
The problem is
it 's no problem for me personally .
After owning Canons and Nikons I tried this one because of the 30 X ZOOM and am VERY PLEASED
Caught a gregarious hummingbird in flight this week
It appears that actual owners of this camera all rate it at a 9 or 10 except for those others who are certainly entitled to their opinions.
Yes, it's huge
I am not a photo genius, but i definitley have learned a lot more since i recieved it 2 months ago
I really prefer having the  option of having both
The only slight compromise is that the video steady shot feature is not quite as good as you would find on a high end consumer video camera
However the size camera alone makes it very much an outlier and for travelers of those who appreciate a more svelte form factor there are better options
I have used many digital cameras.
I narrowed the choices between the following; Olympus VR2, Sony''', Samsung""", Nikon S8100, Cannon'''
. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
I always shoot with the the red label (iA)
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
The photo quality was top notch
Takes great photos
I tried to be positive, but
Hate to wait between shots
Exceeded my expectations
And then there's the video
The Sony a3000 takes clear, noise free photos even in low light and crisp, bright video
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
I purchased this camera as a Christmas present for my husband, meant to be a replacement for a 5 year old Canon Powershot
it is a very amazing product .
I love this camera
The balance is a little strange since the majority of the weight is the excellent zoom, but is comfortable enough in the hand for the average application
My favorite is the &#34;hand held twilight&#34; mode - perfect for getting shots without a flash, just make sure your subjects holds steady
Quality point-and-shoot camera that is easy to use
I kid you not, If you don't get any good picture out of this camera, you do not know what you are doing
The AMAZING feature about this camera is that you can take the pictures, print them for small cute wallet size instant pictures, AND save the images to your computer like a digital camera
for example if you have the lens wide open and you reach too slow of a shutter speed, you can just change the ISO and it will then give you some more parameters to play with
So much better than my other cameras
The pictures come out remarkable
- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
While others miss shots contemplating which lens to use and changing lenses, you won't
Fits well in the hand
I own a Canon SLR, two Fuji bridge cameras, two Olympus point and shoot and one other Panasonic pocket point and shoot
Indoor flash photography
The two speed zoom was nice, easy to control and fairly quiet
i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
it uses ZINK system different polaroid
I did notice there doesn't seem to be an HDMI port, but honestly I never use those anyways on any of the cameras I do have one on
The photos are clear and beautiful and the different options are great
I tried this camera before I bought it at Walmart which was selling it for $319
This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
Highly recommend this camera
I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
Figure out if your needs are what this camera can give you, because I am thoroughly happy with mine and will be giving one to my cousin now that the price has gone down
NOW THIS CAMERA  IS EASY TO USE AND TAKES VERY GOOD AND CLEAR PICTURES AND MOVIES ALSO WONDERFUL
It is also a little easier to focus at the farthest end of the zoom than I thought it would be
It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
com because was cheapper comparing with the other websites and you will receive a pretty cool case in leather for it
It was annoying having to constantly open the flash when I needed it, even in auto mode
Poor design decisions (probably some poor marketing influence, too):1
I also TOTALLY RECOMMEND getting the battery grip:Opteka Battery Pack Grip / Vertical Shutter Release for Canon Rebel T2i, T3i, T4I, T5i,Digital SLR Cameras with 2 Extra LP-E8 Extended Life High Capacity Batteries, Wireless Infrared Remote and Lens Cleaning KitThey add so much to this camera as far as feel
I've taken this camera on two trips- one to Arizona, and one to France
Quick delivery and good product
Nifty camera with inherent problems
I would not recommend this product to ANYONE
sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
I was wrong
Great for vacationers
I thought this would be a wonderful idea for a wedding guest book but the quality of the pictures were poor and it was too small
You see I never want to be caught without batteriesif ever I am in the right place at the right time with my camera at the ready
Nice pics and versatile equipment
Got great shots with the with the telephoto and the shutter speed was fast enough to catch great animal shots
Awesome camara, and looks cute too
According to dpreview
Nikon Coolpix S8100
Love this Camera highly recommennd
I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
Love this camera
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
I no longer take pictures professionally, so I looked into a light weight camera that at least had most of the bells and whistles
a big plus in my book .
Also, the burst shooting is a joke
Also I found the camera to be very prone to silhouetting and washout in outdoor use, and again this is not simply operator error, I am comparing to other similarly-priced cameras I have owned over the years (including various Casio Exilim and Fujifilm FinePix models)
I am going to work on my picture taking skills, and report back to you after I know what I'm supposed to do with all these bells a whistles
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
You cant even film at night time
I recommend this camera to others people
Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.
I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
She wanted a semi-professional camera for her Christmas Vacation to the Dominican Republic
This whole camera was a mess
Some people want to complain about the noise
there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
You can't really get much better than this for a quality point and shoot camera, and the price is reasonable
This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
Great picks, hard to up load
Bottom line: Not worth it
If you are about images, this camera is a delightful tool to use
Nikon S8100 P&S Camera
I did some sample shots inside the house in a dimly light room
I accidentally bumped it once and all the papers fell out
The seller had it to me very quickly and I am extremely satisfied with their packaging and quality of product
3 OSS Lens for $427
Very nice initial impression
Bottom line, whatever camera, in my book it isn't the camera itself
Highly recommend this item as a tool or memory captured moment
We returned the camera
Dropping your f-stop to 1
Amazon rocks in this regard from lens mount adapters to 3rd party batteries and battery chargers
The camera only shoots jpg or Raw+Jpg , you cannot shot just RAW
It's by no means an SLR with different adjustable lens attachments, so if you're looking for that kind of technicality, this isn't the one you want, but for the price, it's an all-around great camera
Poor construction, poor image quality
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
In sum, better buy another brand
The macro shots are great
The video itself is quite amazing
It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
I contacted Nikon's helpsite and they said I must use only the recommended cards
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
So I went for this one, hoping that I would see a dramatic improvement
Well, as the title suggests, so far so good
just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
This camera fits a unique niche
Great camera
Im not an experienced photographer but even on auto its amazing
We have taken about 50 pictures and so far it has been great
1MP Camera - An excellent choice and the price is quite reasonable
1) for it on their website, but you have to buy a SD card reader/writer and implement the fix with a computer yourself
I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
I have found that the video is really great compared to an older video camera I had
issue I should have known about:- The screen is amazing but I was so enamored with it that I didn't realize there was no viewfinder
In fact, I am enjoying this camera more than almost any one I have ever used
Bottom line is I AM VERY HAPPY with this camera
Kool Camera
Only thing I'm not crazy about is having to replace batteries
it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
All had the same results.
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
She really likes that the pictures double as stickers
So you don't have to take a photo and then review it and then make adjustments
The problem is, that the basic performance of this camera body would not motivate me to go out and spend thousands of dollars on lenses
All in all, very impressive camera
it didn't feel particularly sturdy, the screen images were not crisp as I thought they should be, too many negative write-ups by people that were expert in the field (which I am not)
Photo and screen quality are amazing, zoom is impressive for a compact camera, the navigation wheel is very handy and startup is quick
great
then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
Cons: Action shots are blurry even with stable hands, no view finder
if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
Did I also say that the auto focus on this camera is FAST and accurate?  Well, it's "VERY fast, and accurate"
Great for vacation snapshots
From reading the other reviews, I'm thinking either I'm doing something wrong or mine is defective
It looks like one, but has no mirror
Night Photo is amazing
I limped a long with the camera, taking once in a lifetime pictures with a lens that made it look like the camera had a cataract
I highly recommend it
Great Value
New Camera
-CMOS is AWESOME
i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
It has a lot of options for photos
Top Camera
I need to find some time and just learn how
It has worked very well
please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
Oh, of note, the 'so called' manual settings on this camera are very poor
what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
Also, the camera has enough manual settings to get some really nice shots
The picture quality is amazing
LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
My prints came out streaked
No Wi-Fi
Sharp image
It is to me misleading for readers to see a 3
Nice photos
Amazing
My son absolutely loves his camera
Hi,I am unable to write a review of this camera because I have only received defective cameras
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
Yes, it's not a DSLR and it doesn't support Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or 'location', meaning that you will be transferring your work out either through a wire or a card reader adapter and you'll have to make a not of where the photo was taken - I personally don't care much about these features but no everyone is 'me' so it's worth stating it
I took the camera on vacation and didn't get a bad picture
Also, the set up for switching between high speed etc is not really intuitive, I'm still working on playing with that
) is that you can choose which images you print out which means that you save paper and have better memories
It might be merely what I have become accustomed to but as the power switch is positioned in exactly the same location as the zoom switch on the Pentax, I have already turned off the camera a few times when I forgot which body I had in hand (they are very similar in size and weight) and thought I was about to zoom in on a subject
Like most cameras large enough to accept interchangeable lenses, it is obviously designed with right-handed users in mind
but I managed to get a clear picture at night with no light except for that from a tv on the opposite side of a large room
the light auto-correction is awesome .
Great purchase
The flash really drains the battery life quickly
This is a great compact point and shoot camera
For $200 (or less) more The NX 2000 with 2 lenses is a better deal
It is very plasitc-y and feels as if it will break easily
The playback mode doesn't auto-rotate the image (or if it does, I haven't found that setting)
A great birding camera
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
- I wish Sony had just omitted the EVF and went with at least 460k LCD, for an easier manual focusing
The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
the Flash doesn't pop-up automatically when needed like other cameras
Considering how great the battery life is I sort of regret getting two extra batteries
Everyone loved those pictures and we were able to see things from a Cruise ship that we would have never seen otherwise
But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
I am a novice birder and the ability to get a decent picture of a bird a good distance away is helping me learn to id what I was missing before
Sometimes the camera would be able to show me my existing pictures and other times it would not
T3 is best for still shots and is cheaper, has more battery life
BOTTOM LINE: BEAUTIFUL PICTURES AND GREAT FOR STILLS, BUT IF YOU PLAN ON TRYING TO SHOOT ANY MOVING OBJECTS FORGET ABOUT THIS CAMERA
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
"the lightweight alternative"
Things in general are fast, except for two problems which I discuss below
Im still researching a way to print items that were not generated by the camera, but this thing would be that much more valuable if it could be 'just' a printer
Take the time to research the perfect digital camera for you, learn more on photography, and have a very enjoyable time capturing your memories
the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
There is also no external mike jack, so you are relegated to using only the built in mikes
This seems like a no-brainer but but if you forget to do this, you can damage the lens mechanism
The zoom features are awesome it will amaze you how good of images at max zoom even when hand held
I am very pleased with this camera
It was a great addition
always thought that was for Leica but maybe it is for Lumix
I also recently purchased a Panasonic Lumix TS5A, which is a compact waterproof point and shoot
Anyway, I liked this camera, is a beautiful color (I have in red) and I am not professional but I can take good pictures with it
Nikon coolpix L830
I am looking forward to many years of taking photos with my new camera
i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
For about $300, you get a 60X lens that stretches from a heretofore unheard of 20 mm ultra wide to 1200 mm super telephoto, all in a relatively small and light package
I shot most of my shots today, indoors, in manual mode most at 1/25th of a second some at 1/20th at ISOs between 100 & 400
With all the features The Pansonic has I can shoot in any condition
I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
Looking at pictures taken with a Canon T3, and this, there is no comparison
I am using DSLR but sometimes I really need a small and talented compact camera
My wife and I are very pleased with this compact camera
If you're looking for a great entry level point and shoot camera with many advanced features then you can't go wrong
It takes great night pictures and video, still checking all the extras out
She has been enjoying  the functional ease  of it  and the nice pictures  it takes
I do not regret my purchase
Easy to use
Lots of modes and features, I've barely explored some of them
change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
My reservations-  Hate not having a viewfinder
You have many shooting options which is great
a card with more memory is a must .
It is attractive and well designed
And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30.
When I got back, I returned the Coolpix and purchased this Lumix, and have not regretted it a bit
I really love the size, feel and capabilities - excellent zoom and functions, but after only about 7 weeks of use, this camera lens locked and I got the "lens error" message - while on the second day of my vacation in Austria
I wanted a new camera, but I didn't want to spend too much money on it
The finish feels like it is rubberized or something
PICTURES AND VIDEO AT THE SAME TIME
It took them 45 minutes to answer one question, including the time it took them to give me the answer to a question someone else asked
If you are shopping for a DSLR camera, be aware -- this is not the one
The camera works well in low light, occasionally I got a warning to pop open the flash
Thanks for Canon Camera great and small in size and the most beautiful pictures of the property Send Mobile and zoom Excellent
The lens has a great range to it, the wide angle is indispensable
There are only a couple of minute issues I have with it overall
Our distance ranged from 1/3 to 3/4 miles from the racing craft and the zoom gave me exceptional photos
you can always spend more money to get a better one .
I liked the idea of a viewdinder and a hotshoe,both of which my nex doesnt have
Have not printed yet but am encouraged
It takes beautiful photos, crisp and clear
3 sensor
This camera is it
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
Secondly, the ease of use and capability of taking great photos right out of the box, especially in iAuto mode was astonishing
Great bag with the all-important AW cover
i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
Flash photos tend to have exceptionally poor color, relative to how well the camera does everything else
I like that you can choose the photos you want to print instead of printing every shot; the photo paper is conserved for the images you really want printed and you can keep others you don't
The fact that is digital makes a lot better then the old polaroids that required film
The Quality is Good
The pictures have been greaat so far
Loved this camera
I'm still testing it out, but so far its definitely a keeper
Also very impressed with some of the special easy to use special effects like the background blur as well as others
Although I am primarily a still photographer, I have tried the video on several occasions and find that works well also
the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
Better than I thought
Since it is just past the one year warranty, it too is junk
Well it only had four shots on
Other factors are the viewfinders as at 230K pixelation neither the non-tilting LCD nor low resolution EVF are very impressive
I compared it to mirror less Samsung NX2000with 20-50mm and 50-200mm lenses, and DSLR camera 18-200mm, looking for reasonable quality photos
Nikon does have a newer model out (Coolpix S9100) but I didn't see the point in spending the extra money, especially since the differences between the 2 models are minimal
But compared to a regular digital camer this is very poor quality
Always before when the "white light" started to appear I would have to stop recording because the white line appeared in the video
New 16MP high-resolution, high-speed CMOS Sensor
It's a similar &#34;bridge&#34; camera, fitting between point and shoot and DSLR, but is now several years behind the times
Neither of these Transcend cards or any of the other 4 SD cards I already had would work in the camera
It's a great size and it prints perfect Polaroid pictures
This camera takes EXCELLENT photos for a point and shoot
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
Great camera
Be aware it does NOT come with a removeable memory card
Great Camera
I had to send it back to Nikon for repair, which they did because it was still covered by warranty
The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice.
they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
The main complaint is the fact that every time I want to remove the memory card or replace the battery with a fresh one, I have to totally remove it from my tripod
It is now April and my camera is already back to Nikon for repair
But it doesn't have a flat front profile
works good
Like others, I have found it very difficult to get a decent quality image from this camera
Not soft
CAREFUL
Middle price and use bridge type camera
The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
The HD video is also super cool
I have already received it and, so  far, I am getting great results for both purposes, familiy and work
i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
Except, of course, if you do not choose the perfect thing to photograph
Outstanding Camera With Numerous Small Downsides
I could not be more pleased
There's much to like about this camera: long 30x zoom, quick and accurate focus, true HD video, relatively good build quality
this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
I have to change one
but this camera is great !
It was also very easy to switch from still pictures to video
Give the gift of instant pictures to your family and friends right on the spot
First off, this is a $279 camera which gives you DSLR type features (interchangeable lens, comfortable grip, hot shoe) AND a fantastic 20MP sensor
I purchased a 32 BG memory card and you can hold an amazing number of photographs or you can turn this into a video camera
The LCD screen is low res
Went to Grapefruit League spring training games - bright Florida sunlight
We had a photo guest book so people could take their own pictures and put them in our book
This is also the only camera I've used with manual lenses that works in the &#34;intelligent&#34; modes with any lens
I use this camera as an alternative to carrying my DSLR
Love this camera
very nice style
Be sure to spend some time with the instructions
It takes incredible photos, GREAT video and is easy to use
downloads are a snap and quick .
Does not have hdmi output
The screen seems fine for this price range, the EVF is  good enough for composing images and is a big plus in bright sunlight
Practice with settings and feel before you &#34;need&#34; it
It took amazing pictures
Overall I liked it and wished that it would have worked out
I wanted to replace my Coolpix P100 that is a GREAT camera
Though, these cameras are very similar in their class and both manufacturers have excellent reputations, there was a line up of subtle differences that were slightly &#34;improved&#34; with the Nikon Coolpix L830
The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
Love the tilting screen and the pic quality is very nice
it appears it would survive a truck driving over it
i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
The 18-55mmm kit lens is perfect for most shooting situations
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
Also, after 2 months the lens cover stopped opening when we turned on the power rendering the camera unusable
The basic 18-55 lens is great for your daily pictures plus you have the option of getting different purpose lens as well
PROS:- easy to use, right out the box- battery life better  than expected- great value @ $279
I use it mostly on Auto and it works extremely well
One the cable used to connect the camera to the computer is only about 24" long
I want to make sure I get tons of great pictures
Zoomed in, the washed out look became even more pronounced
my story is based on personal usage .
+Good weight and balance, feels sturdy, unlike the Sony fixed-lens cameras I've tested recently+Quiet operation+Good Battery Life+Proper manual and priority modes-Underwhelming viewfinder and LCD panel on the back-Slow and sometimes flakey autofocus when not in broad daylight-Forcing JPG to save with RAW
It is small and light enough to carry around all day, yet capable of taking great photos
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
It also compensates so that you don't find people up close are overexposed while everything in the background goes dark
Read the manual, you'll learn a bit about the options (still have to figure what the 16 panel speed shot mode is about)
No chance of dust and stuff getting in the camera,especially on windy days
Very intuitive, great functionality and better yet great quality pictures
No more lenses to change
It's not very heavy and really it's not too thick, it's about the length of your thumb (unless you have really, really big thumbs)
here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
great camera
needed mine, wife had it when i needed it
The audio is not as impressive, but it does the job
bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
Most point-and-shoot digital cameras that you can buy today for under $200 don't allow you to adjust these things but really if you're serious about photography learning how shutter speed and aperture work together to create photographs is very important
It takes great shots and the flexible viewfinder display is great for taking picture's in a crowd
A thrill to own
I give it 4 stars only because the GPS function is missing
Most of my indoor shots were without flash and came out wonderfully
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
0 MEGAMIXEL Cybershot DSC-H55
In fact, this camera is like car with automatic transmission, all attempts to compare it with DSLR are  like comparing to a car with standard shift, it is just not
The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark.
If you're going to stare at a camera's LCD screen all day maybe this isn't the camera for you but if you want GREAT IMAGES then definitely buy this camera
I looked into getting it repaired in China but the prices approached those of a new  camera and the expert shops said they couldn't get the part since it was made for the American market
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
once the light went off in the brain it became a very simple task; however; I did think that all was lost the first time around
Great zoom, very good Continuous
Impressive
I've gotten used to grainy pictures in dimily lit rooms (and ironically this camera does a wonderful job at improving that, so that it's usually a non-issue
The only true fake thing here is the view finder: you do not see through the lens, cause it is not an optical feature, but will be looking at tiny LED repeater of larger screen
better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
raw, this still won't touch a dslr BUT this probably has the best looking point and shoot photos i've seen across many brands (sony, kodak, pentax, canon, and olympus)
It's a little bit bigger than its predecessor (SX280) but it is very well built and has an attractive look and feel (I like the black one)
I can't imagine anyone other than a professional photographer not being highly satisfied with his or her resultsc
In the end I can't see how they can justify the cost
I am not a professional photographer and am still trying to figure out some of the features on the camera
I do not know if this just affects my sample
and does very well in low light
Not very good
AF was fast enough for an outdoor event
I have had this little gem for four months now.
I have had the camera just over the 30 day guarantee with Amazon and the lens stopped functioning
for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
Had to send it back sadly
I do not want to be confined to Canon software to annotate, organize, and store my photos and download via Wi-Fi
Great Little Camera
Anyone can use it
Although I was buying a &#34;open box&#34; product I expected that all items would be in the box, however that wasn't the case, the camera was just thrown in the box, battery was loose and there was NO battery charger included
Seemed like a great deal
they take excellent macro shots as well .
First, the camera does a remarkable job recognizing back lite scenes and compensates remarkably well
Trudging through castles and churches, Photokina and Octoberfest, I wanted small with interchangeable lenses, the whole kit  with the 12mm, 16mm, 18-55, 55-200 weighs less than one unit of the larger size
My Nex F3 was very good and takes great pictures, this is noticeably better
I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
It looks like a DSLR but it's pretty compact and light
ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
I have experimented with some of the special features while reading the manual
highly recommended .
Some people have been complaining that it feels a bit flimsy & like a toy camera
Thats a plus in my book
2 thumbs up
Build quality seems good
Five Stars
The NX2000 and the DSLR were almost equal in outdoor sunny day photograpy, but the Panasonic quality was not there
This camera is very easy to use
I absolutely LOVE this camera
In low-light indoor situations, I needed a steady hand to avoid motion blur
i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
You will know it is there, but it is not bothersome
I found out it will not work with iPhoto or Aperture as of this date,maybe in the future
I also do notlike the non-standard USB cable for data transfer but I'm using a card reader anyway so yes, it's bad but not too bad
There's an option for 1600 and 3200, and while I use them infrequently as they're nosier, I'm glad they're an option
I'm glad I bought it
1- Small.
The 10x zoom is more then enough, I mainly use this camera to take everyday family pictures so the zoom does not get used much
i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
The only thing I don't like is the case with the magnetic clasp
That whole full HD video was not HD at all
This is a great little camera
Zoom is awesome
All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
I would have given it 5 stars except for pictures taken of small children or animals
So nice and compact
I was able to pull it out of the box and start taking pictures right away
The 34x Zoom works great, and is very to  operate
With a bit of effort, a friend and I removed a grain of sand and the camera worked again
easy to use good price thanx
I wanted something that I could leave a photo with the folks I took pictures of
As expected, cheaper than the competition and as good as the competition
Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3
Remember to buy a memory card too
Transferring your images from the camera to the computer is quick and easy
Several cameras are as good or better performers, for less money
I was a bit skeptical because the price of this camera was so low, so I went to walmart to try it out and fell in love
Seriously Nikon?  Put a viewfinder in this camera and it would get 10 stars
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
Nikon Coolpix S8100
a 2014 release with NO Orientation Sensor
The only drawback is that it works with AA  batteries but they seem to last long
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
I highly recommend this model
so I can charge a battery without it being in the camera, which seems to be an issue with some users
This is SO easy to use
It works well in low-light and takes videos worthy of all your family memories
Hopefully Polaroid will improve it in future versions
once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
The prints would come out discolored and low quality
Like it's predecessor, the Canon T5 is a no-frills DSLR whose primary focus is taking decent pictures
Flying bird photos just did not work well at all
i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
The video's turned out good also
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
Bought this camera about a month ago
Sound is good on video, pictures are clean and sharp
Best of all, the instant camera prints are only 50 cents a piece
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
Small enough to put in your handbag and works like a professional camera
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
I can share images and video easily to my phone
The 60X zoom is amazing
It had more uses than I expected so I'm still learning
This FZ70 is bulky & gets weighty over the course of the day, but when going between distance & zoom, and between speed shots & low light shots, it is hard to beat
Not a ground-breaking product, but solid and dependable nonetheless
This year I was ahead of the game, I ordered right after Thanksgiving and I received it 2 days later
I can now say with first hand information, that Nikon is now making JUNK
She took a picture  of a deer in the woods
A new powerful 30x optical zoom lens in just a pocket-size body
So far, even with a polarizer, the photos were a little overexposed and it took a while until I found the exposure compensation control so that my pictures could be slightly underexposed, giving me more saturation
And it's not even noisy (grainy)
I am looking for a compact digital camera for a long time
DO NOT expect some DSLR or mirrorless cameras' image quality
Love the details of birds  at 60x
I do like the tilting view screen, though, which is something I've never seen before
I'm about to resell mine and get a cute, cheap point and shoot
This Nikon s8100 a just a little bigger and heavier (10x Zoom) than the Canon IS1100, 1200, 1300, 1400s (3x Zooms), needs a "slightly" bigger case
i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
For camera users who have larger hands, the A3000 is indeed much easier to handle than a NEX3N, for example
I am so looking forward to taking more pictures with this great camera
The L830 can use all three types
Sony A3000 - great entry level camera at an even greater price
Nikon L830 Great Camera
My experience with the 280 really shook my faith in Canon but I decided to take a chance with the sx700 in hopes of getting essentially a 280 that worked
Extremely clear and realistic
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
This is a very sophisticated camera and it will take a lot of time to really master all the things this camera can do
I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
Don't zoom to the full length and don't use C-AF
The FZ70 is a bit bigger than I expected, but there's a lot of lens to house, so understandable
i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
Most digital cameras for years do not include one as the options are huge and each person has their own needs on how much storage they need (and they're cheap)
I sent it back
I was also looking for a camera to take non-flash pictures at events such as communions and dance recitals
I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
If you are shooting a lot of low-light, you may also want the T5i
I do like the ability of having a separate button for videos in addition to the normal shutter release
But if you already have a 4/3rds, or DSLR
The SX700 has an incredible 30x optical zoom ranging from true wide angle at 25mm (full frame equiv)  to 750mm telephoto (full frame equiv)
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
As unhappy as I have been returning the cameras, I am very impressed and grateful to Amazon for their incredibly generous and pleasant customer service
Then the flash cover (plastic) fell off because it is only glued on, and in Mass we have humidity and heat
It was time to upgrade
In other words, the photos are great for a sub-$100 camera, as long as all of your photos are taken in the landscape (horizontal) orientation
The included 18-55 zoom feels mechanically solid for a kit lens, and it's also fairly sharp corner to corner
It has 2 panorama modes, 180 degrees and 360 degrees and they're the best I've seen
I have had it less than a year though and the battery is shot
So far i love and i am an amature
The zoom on this is really good, even from the 20 yd line I was able to snap close up pics of the colts on the opposite end of the field
overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
- lag or hesitation where I try to take a picture quickly but it won't focus and therefore won't take the picture (usually after I just turned it on but sometimes randomly)
Looks like I am standing right next to him
it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
It's easy to use in auto mode or has plenty of settings for the novis/hobbist that doesn't want to invest a couple of grand in lense's and bodies
Also The White balance was horrible
I love this camera
i 'm very glad i did .
I love my new camera
Newly acquired
good
2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
We bought a competing product -- for quite less money
Doesn't work well in low light even with the flash
Despite reading a number of negative reviews, initially, I'm very pleased with the quality
Great pictures and I like the 34x zoom lens
The zoom is amazing
It's good enough and fast enough for anyone but a hard core pro
do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
Sometimes it comes on and won't even show anything on the screen
that create dramatic effects you would work your rear end off doing on the computer sandwiching a series of bracketed photos
The -4 to +3 5 diopter allows for a good range of personal diopter adjustment and this is very important when you are using a non-point-and-shoot camera
The zoom works very well
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
After several clips I check the battery status and it shows almost full
this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
me and this camera, we go everywhere
depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
I got this for Christmas
By far, this is the best camera I have
It was well worth the purchase
The camera is fantastic
Good value and my daughter loves it too
Very nice but with common problem of LED/LCD screens
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
Horrible quality
It works great and I don't have to carry extra len's and equipment like I do when i use my Canon 70D
Pros: Terrific form factor, brilliant LCD screen, 10x optical zoom, usual Nikon quality, support, warranty
If taking movies, it can work for only less than one hour
I love this camara, it is amazing what you can do with it and its zoom is awsome
Excellent camera
The image stabilization is excellent
So easy to use that even I managed to get some spectacular photos
This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
I have a collection of truly impressive clear pictures that I only wish I could share with you
I think this was the best idea to come up with this camera along with the lens together as a bundle deal
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
Whenever I leave the house, it is in is case on my belt, ready for use
Delivery was on time as promised
Enough has been said on the reviews to add my comments in any detail, but overall this is a great camera - great photos so far in a variety of lighting conditions
My only complaint would be no viewfinder
Nothing but Awesome
larry ponziani
Great instant print/digital camera hybrid
Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
Third camera for a family member
) And the price was reasonable
It really beats my 16
However, with Christmas shopping upon us, I have noticed some lower prices being advertised so check around for the best price before you purchase one as a local chain store might be less expensive
i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
I've considered getting the gear necessary to take good photos, but the investment, both in dollars and weight, is significant
I take it with me everywhere,literally,
here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
Once mastered, it should prove to be a very nice camera to own and operate
Good camera for the price
After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
Not bad for a non professional or aficionado with a "multipurpose" digital camera
Lots of fun
Instead you can select between two viewers: the electronic viewfinder or the 7
they said it is in stock , but they are " too busy " .
Unfortunately I thought it was a viewfinder camera and it is not
LCD screen is beautiful and high resolution
Several features contributed to this
As a traveler and someone who frequently goes between regular view and zoom for variations of the same shot, a camera like this Lumix "all-in-one" continues the best camera to suit my needs because I don't have time or patience to switch lenses, and a lens that can handle regular to zoom on an SLR camera is easily a thousand dollars
I printed a few shots as 8
Maybe I am just accustomed to the DSLR look, as my personal cameras are a Canon 5D Mk III and a Canon 6D, but I really do think that this is a nice looking camera that fits well into the hand
The pictures we have taken so far are so crisp and clear it will blow you away
basically everything about it
i use this as a second camera
9) The resolution at high zoom and ability to take pictures in low light is excellent, BUT, unfortunately, if you want a clear picture in low light, you have to hold it pretty still, so the image stabilization is still weak
Not a great camera for action or concerts
*I also have the Z340: if you print a picture taken with the Z2300 on the Z340 it has much better color, so if you hesitate between the Z2300 or Z340 I can recommend the Z340
Battery has good staying power
Although slightly larger than the other cameras, I like the size and ease of handling
However, it is bigger than i expected, and I don't know if I'm a fan of the entire blue color on the pictures I print
I wish the quality was better
If I had known more about photography and could have set if for manual settings, I might have done some better, but overall quality of the pictures was amazing
Also, so far I have found it to be quite fast with little shutter lag and good in low light situations
My eyes are over 40 years old (the rest of me feels 29) so I have some trouble seeing up close
Also zooming and focusing sounds can be heard very loudly in any shot video
Usually I wait for the reviews and buy then but the features on this looked good and besides, its Christmas

Really, the only negative I can think of is finding your way through the different menus and what all of the buttons and dials do
Great compromise
This camera is a bit bulkier than the average compact camera, but worth the size due to all the features
probably 1 in 5 is good
Though the internal memory did allow me to take 22 pictures and a 15 second video before running out of space, so there's plenty of room to try it out before investing in a memory card
nice, large display, with the flash location not an issue for me at all
Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
I love it
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
Great Camera
First off, the battery.
Full 1080p out of such an inexpensive and already feature packed camera with the quality it offers is amazing
It failed at both
The flash is bright and good at not blowing out images
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
The zoom really is incredible in this camera
On the other hand, the resolution of both the viewfinder and the rear screen are rather low
Sony had great (most important to me) wide angle lens, good telephoto and the very great sweep panorama feature, pretty good screen images, BUT I was astounded how cheap and toy-like the unit felt to me in my hand
Image stabilization is not even close to the same level as a DSLR or even the Olympus OM series
5) I can't get the battery to last more than 35 minutes
Also it has a very quality and good looking finish
very glad of purchase after much review about features and price
The lens wouldn't retract and the power stayed on with a "Lens Error" message on the screen
inconsistent quality
Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
I would have given it a 5star if not for the size
Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
the g2 was better in this respect .
unfortunately we are no longer able to
I learned that I can use the 60 X manual focus but that I'm not restricted to that
Quick time between photos, surprisingly quick flash cycling even
The digital zoom on this camera produces pretty good photos
The camera would not turn off or retract the lends
If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
When the camera works the pictures are beautiful and the camera is easy to use as well
All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
All in all, no complaints
Bought this camera as a refurbished item at a really good price
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
It doesn't respond as quickly as I expected and am missing some good shots
The setting most people will usually use is the iA setting and it is rather inconspicuous in size at least, on the mode dial/wheel
Nikon COOLPIX L830
there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
very easy to use .
It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
at a price I could afford
The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
Plus video is beautiful
I bought a kodak camera which I returned because it was terrible and this nikon has been a wonderful replacement
Currently it seems to be available at some pretty attractive pricing, which would seem to support my impression that it doesn't have a very well defined target audience
Zoom pictures up on stage came out clear and bright
Fantastic point & shoot
As stated in some other reviews, the flash comes up where your finger typically rests, but I have just learned to move my finger out of the way
, , very cheap
thank you
)Note:  I first tried the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS19
This camera will produce great everyday photos with the base kit and has features that will allow those who are interested in more flexibility than is typically the case with most point and shoot cameras to upgrade their equipment without being initially overwhelmed, but for the experienced DSLR user this model is most likely one that can be passed by
It's a little larger than most models but it still is carried in my front jean pocket at all times
All in all I am delighted with this camera
Of the dozen or so other digital cameras I've used over the years, this Lumix was able to access, load, and save the pictures to the internal memory faster than any other
I don't like the battery and battery charger set-up either
nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
This camera has far superior clarity in still pictures compared to the Fujifilm S8200 and when filming in HD, this camera has no interlacing issues when moving the camera like the Fujifilm S8200
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
Since I own two Panasonic cameras I have to be creative when importing photos
It was also very reasonably priced
I found that in normal room lighting, even at night, it is not necessary (or advisable) to use the flash
Battery Drain
before i " get used to it " , here are my first feelings :
I'm a midrange amateur photographer, upgrading from an earlier Olympus 3mp digital
I can already take near-perfect HD video with clear stereo sound, macro photos, beautiful low-light shots and, with a tripod, I did a pretty good portrait of the Moon at 60x zoom and max res
It is easy to use, great features, and compact so you can still tote it around everywhere you go
I have not used the video feature so can't comment on that
The processor is able to keep up with the 1080i video at 60 fps with no blur during pans or when recording fast objects
If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
The only thing I am not sure of is the selector/adjustor wheel if this mechanism proves to be reliable then I think we have another winner here
I can enlarge photos from my FZ200 and get a lot better results for the wildlife photos i take than this camera
Most of the icons in the manual as well as on the camera are meaningless?
WOW
The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
Great camera for the photographically challenged, stabilization is superb
do n't let my five star rating fool you .
My previous favorite camera was a Fujifilm FX1, and while I still love it, I think I like this Panasonic slightly better - it seems to be easier to get a nice sharp focus
I wanted a super-zoom too and got the Coolpix P530 because we use Nikon's at my office and I was very familiar with the interface
I was very pleased with the results
When it worked, I loved the S8100
I've come close to dropping the camera a couple of times and always keep the strap around my wrist
I bought this camera about 6 months ago to have something more portable then my D-SLR, and it has went beyond my expectations for a point and shoot camera
Relatively lightweight, beautiful shutter response, and the test of all tests for images--at full resolution, pristinely clear quality (little noise in the right lighting)
Super Travel Camera for Long-Distance
But I quickly got used to it and trained myself to place my hand elsewhere
Wow,,,it almost breaks my heart to return it because the zoom is so amazing
The camera served me well for about 2/3 of the trip, but then the lens started to not close and the display showed a lens error
It is a little more involved than a traditional point and shoot camera
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
blurry
7) There is no battery bar on the screen nor in the menu, I've yet to see it after using this cam many times
Very easy to use, features are intuitive, menus are simple but give you a lot of options if you want to get creative
But as I said, the proof is in the final product so if you would like to see a sample of images - reply to this review and include your email address and I'll share a few with you
So please, read the specs on this because I can't explain what they mean anyway
i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
I received my Nikon quickly, well packaged and exactly as advertised
me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
The flash works very well and is strong enough that I really cannot complain
Much better
It has a very fast auto-focus
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
If you're looking for a high end camera but aren't ready for a DSLR (or if you have a DSLR and sometimes just want a simple point and shoot) then I would definitely recommend this one
For example, it recognized when I was taking a close-up photo and appropriately adjusted the aperture and shutter speeds to give me sharp detail in the foreground, with a softly blurred background
took pictures of granddaughters prom in front of window no back lighting
Love love this camera
I'm a mom who loves taking pictures of her kids, pets and flowers
5-axis Dynamic Image Stabilization and continuous AF for movies
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
I look forward to using the camera outside in brighter light
Perfect for outdoors
It also doesn't automatically reposition pics taken in portrait mode (you'll need to put the camera upright to review)
love this camera
Doing a lot of low-light work? The ISO range of the T5i is larger: T5 100 - 12,800 vs T5i 100 - 25,600The T5i has a 9 point cross-type Autofocus  vs only 1 in the T5The T5 has about 100 shots MORE of battery life than the T5i
This Nikon has completely changed my mind about the brand and I will be a Nikon loyalist from now on :)
This is really not enough for me
Lens quality is amazing and a nice wide angle minimum focal length
The new sensor is unbelievable
Picture quality is excellent, and the performance in low light is just as good as on the NEX
I am more than happy with this camera
it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
The zoom is phenominal and even with a tripod or monopod, you do lose some quality when zoomed all the way out, but still are good pics
Five Stars
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
(I did not want to be the person kicked out of an awards show)
This camera is extremely versatile and easy to lug around
It doesn't necessarily feel cheap, either
Makes me feel like I know what I am doing
See if your local library has them, or download an ecopy
I'd bet your paycheck that most of the problem is camera movement since it is very difficult to hand hold any camera still enough at this extreme magnification to get a super sharp picture - regardless of image stabilization system employed
I compare the Canon and sony cameras with S8100 and I can say that this is a clean win for Nikon
Not very high quality images
I would reccomend this to everyone
great camera .
It shoots nice pictures
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
Focus was fast, shot to shot recycle time was impressive, battery life was astounding (well over 400 pictures and the battery just dropped by one indicator on the 3-light battery bar)
The pocket camera does what it was designed to do
but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
This one fits the bill beautifully
FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
This one I could zoom right up to her face and it was crystal clear
meaning when it needs the flash it has a message in the view finder or the LCD screen to open the flash
End of story.
You can also upload to Mac or windows and print off larger images
Five Stars
Just tilt screen up to you and click
I can't emphasize this point enough: this is one of the main reasons why I bought the camera
However, I really wished I would've done a little more research because I do keep in touch via social media with my family and this would have been a few steps easier to upload pictures had it had built in wifi like the Canon SX510
While this camera is nice and takes decent pictures, I just couldn't deal with the size of it
It seems wrong that at this point, I prefer my older/lighter Panasonic bridge camera or my new compact waterproof camera to this one
duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
However, having it raised, and over the lens does reduce red eye
Also keep these few things in mind based on the questions I've seen here on Amazon so far
some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
So happy with the low light pictures too
My A650 takes better pictures a significant percentage of the time and will continue to be in my camera bag until it eventually gives up the ghost
I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
It was a great addition
Recognizing the features this does not seem to be a great problem
We decided to go with the Nikon because of the 1080p video, cmos chip for lowlight shooting and 914k pixel LCD
We both liked it so much that I bought another one for myself
I thought it would help me get great shots of the kids doing their sports, music performances, etc from my seat far up in the stands
I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
DSLR's are just not in my budget with the lenses costing so much so I got this
Four Stars
This is a great little point and shoot camera
works great- but low memory/battery
Get out and about and enjoy
I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
the 60x lens with image stabilization is amazing
Now as to the camera itself
Buy it, you will love it.....
unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
its more like printer than polaroid
( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
I can't find the info from Polaroid's website but I don't think this LCD has a good quality
With regard to the camera,its a complete disappointment
I then bought a Panasonic that I used a lot and really liked but after 4 years I thought I could get a better camera
Would've if the screen had swivel/tilt, but this was not a surprise to me
poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
Really great little camera
While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.
right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
That is available in &#34;P&#34;(program) mode
The zoom is seamless and it focuses faster and clearer throughout the entire range than many SLR lenses I've used
I tested and compared the Canon SX50 in-store, and while that is also a very capable camera, the Lumix just feels and looks so much more high-quality in person
I used POGO 2x3 papers (cheaper) and the premium photo papers (expensive) and can not tell the difference between the two
The challenge has always been low light and indoors
The images are sharp
I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
Excellent camera that takes high quality pictures quickly and easily
They give great photo quality, it has everything you would need for a great photo
If you shoot in dim lighting you may wish to consider something with a bigger sensor, faster maximum aperture and/or a hot shoe for an external flash
And using the low light setting, such as what you would use with a birthday cake with candles type of picture, works amazingly well
It has a great zoom,has the latest Digic 6 Image Processor,shoots awesome video,and is made in Japan
Being disabled I do not have the luxury of being able to pop round the the Ye Olde Photo Shoppe for a bracing battery refill
Using it on full auto, snapping pictures of kids
It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office ñ where no one goes but me.
No doubt a great value
(2) Ease of use - it doesn't matter if you're used to another brand of pocket camera before: this one is extremely intuitive and easy to pick up
Amazing Camera
This camera at its low price is a lot of bang for the buck
a little pricy for being such an outdated version of a camera
THROW THE CASE AWAY
Great Camera
With great color, good detail capture, decent exposure, and solid (but not class-leading) high ISO performance
Disappointed
I'm using a 32Gig Class 10 SanDisk HC Ultra Memory card from Best Buy for $24 and it will allow me to take over 3000 photos
Great quality and the pictures are clear and it has a fast shutter speed to catch  my 18mo old son
It's very easy to use and takes great pictures
If the birds are distant, well, you at least have a record shot
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
The camera has some surprising and easy to use features that I was UNAWARE of when I bought it
This camera does great with the flash off of grabbing the image better and with more detail than you can see with your eyes
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
Anyone who has used a digital camera made in the last three years wont have any issues with it at all
The screen is not as sharp, the EVF is OK but a little grainy; shooting speed is only 3
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
This explains why I can say I traveled to at least 15 stores over several months to demonstrate, test and fondle, easily, 50 cameras
This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
negative points :
This also has some bearing on the night or low light pictures taken with the S8100
Excellent size, light and high quality photographyBut the price is not suitableI love it for ever and ever
This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
Great Camera
I'm very pleased with this camera
Low light pics: very nice
Depth of field, while not film-like, was better than most video cameras
We live in South Texas, and have not yet, explored all of what Nature has to offer
I can also take multiple pictures in rapid succession
The Sony menus are a little tricky, but once you have learned how to use, you are good to go
many before me have done that already .
At 60x, fz70 has almost twice the optical zoom of my fz200 and I can still use the doubling lens I bought for the fz200 once I purchase an adapter if I need more than a 1200mm zoom
If you're buying this to shoot primarily stills, you'll be very happy
Other reviews suggest thie Nikon Coolpix L830 suffers in build quality well that bug must have been fixed
This is such a vast improvement over that first one that it's hard for me not to be enthusiastic about it
I bought this camera from my daughter for her birthday and she likes the one we have which is a slightly older model
I'm not sorry I purchased it however, I suspect I will only use it a few times a year
HAPPY
The outdoor shots are great
Since I do a lot of work on photoshop, I really appreciate the large resolution that the images come in (5152x3864)
Sure, a DSLR (who's lens would cost more than this camera
Also, the door for the batteries and SD card feels a little flimsy
i just thought it's cute and cool =)
Mediocre Camera for the Price
The zoom is nice
The main sacrifice in quality is in the LCD and EVF (electronic view finder) which have lower resolutions
And, if you don't want the flash on (I avoid using it on this camera), holding your finger over the flash means you'll never be surprised by the flash going off unintentionally
Easily fits into my waterproof case for taking out kayaking
When I called in I was told to take the batteries and sd card out and replace them
Loving it so far
After following all of their directions for mailing my camera (costing close to $20), I receive my estimate of repairs
IQ clarity is a strength for this camera
However, it was not so in my case.
Out of 128 pictures taken from my walk, over half had to be deleted
Yet, it is not overwhelming to learn
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
no needing to scan those tiny little pictures :)
great camera for the price
The Nikon Coolpix L830 does not exactly slip into a shirt pocket but it can be completely concealed in one of my big brothers massive hands
The A3000 differs from the A37 in other ways as well since a lot more of its functions are in the menu
The preset modes can also be manipulated to produce high contrast and backlit effects, among others I have yet to fully explore
overall it is the best camera on the market .
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
Everything seems great so far
Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
well worth the money
But you can get fantastic, and often sharper photos if you experiment with one or more of the details you can change on this camera, and the way you set up the focus for a photo is one of the most important variables
The video works great also and zoom works equally well for the video
Need to purchase memory
Great Camera
it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
Lens quality is amazing with a 10x (300m) zoom and a nice wide angle 30m minimum focal length
they stop time .
This is a gadget in all the sense of the word, not something professional photographers or nitpickers should get, because you will be disappointed
for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
The adjustment is easy and smooth, and the control stays solid once adjusted
Good enough for me
First, the still photos are extremely high quality
i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
The mode dial (PASM) is tight requiring an unusual amount of force for this type of dial
and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
Very poor picture quality
The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
Love it
So detailed as you review your work, I can even see how good my pictures are without having to use my laptop
The flash pops up where you put your finger, but you get used to it
I had considered a D-SLR, however this camera is all I need, and then some
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
Don't waste your money
I want to "love" this camera, but right now I just "like" it
I will be using this for my upcoming vacation and leaving the bulky lenses and accessories for my DSLR at home
The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
For a camera in its class it does a great job with both of the features I mentioned just know it is simply not going to have the abilities of a camera like say the Canon EOS Rebel T3i or above
The problem is that when you take a photo, and you want to get the best results, and the image is not good, sometimes you can not duplicate that moment
Inexpensive camera has amazing zoom feature
I love everything about this camera, quick and easy instructions for the &#34;how to's&#34; no film came with it, but I ordered it on amazon prime and it was delivered in 2 days
Accessories are also available
DMC-FZ70 is definitely a good buy for the price
We were looking at purchasing the S9000 camera, but this one had better reviews and now I know why
VERY FAST FOCUSING AAND FAST ZOOM
i don't know if i just got used to my A60 or it's just really not that loud.
UPDATE:One Month Later:  This camera needs a lot of light to perform at its best
Absolutely LOVE this camera
I took the camera into Best Buy to find a camera bag for it
If you are shooting a lot of video with a DSLR, you'll probably want the T5i
It is easy to use
I wanted to be able to easily take pictures of items and upload them online
This camera is great, easy to use, you can take pictures and also HD Video, which is just amazing
The macro is so much better than my old camera (a small digital point and shoot, its a trooper, but very basic) I tested it out on some earrings and was able to get very crisp extreme closeups, with little need for editing
Eventually the power settings kick in and the lens retracts, but every other camera I've seen has a PLAY setting that doesn't engage the lens
2) the controls are NOT intuitive and are semi difficult to useI bought this camera in December 2010 and if I had to decide again, I would have / should have bought the more intuitive Cannon
I think the manual features available also make this a real competitor to a small lens, entry level DSLR
It doesn't explain the different modes at all, and gives no tips on getting good shots
Image stabilization is top-notch, as I have been able to take several long-zoom outdoor shots without a tripod with ease, just using simple technique tricks like using the viewfinder while bracing elbows against the body, etc
Upon picking up the camera, the first thing I liked was the feel
I like the idea of the camera (the printing is pretty awesome, if you can take a picture clear enough to be worth printing) more than the camera itself
This camera is highly recommended
buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
Excellent features for low-light photography -- including a double-exposure mode to capture that great sunset with your foreground subjects illuminated with flash
It's not worth 200 bux
Also, compared to the FZ200, iZoom performs much better, fewer artifacts, very usable pics
I love it
but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
I especially love the fact that it is mirrorless and weighs less than a traditional dslr, this has no effect on the picture quality however
is a good article, I arrive on time and in perfect condition, not to be a professional camera takes very good pictures, just make a suggestion, I include an external memory to the article
I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.
The zoom on this camera is amazing, the pictures I take using the 34x zoom are clear and crisp
Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
I guess I just need to spend more money if I want a camera that will take pictures of fast movement
I brought replacement batteries and they got me by for another week, and then those died too
The camera is not fast compared to DSLRs, but it's fast enough
" When I printed the photo, the colours were washed out, the text on the border was cut off so I could only see 1/3 of it, and the entire image was pixelated
When using zoom it doesn't take clear pics right off
Lots of Zoom
If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
This is a very nice camera
they were really surprising SOOC
I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
[EDIT:] addressed in comment, thanks
Cool camera
There is no need to haul a whole bag of heavy lenses in order to take different shots
It's just another camera
I decided to spend the money for a good one and this seems to be it
This is a bit thicker than the other digital cameras, but we knew that going in
In the past when I have used the digital zoom on other cameras the picture quality was horrible
This is only the first day of using the sx700 but it's performance has been impressive
Recommend It
1, It repeatedly report &#34;lens error&#34; and now died
Still trying to figure out some settings, but it's not a disappointment
com, search for "Kodak photography books" or any book you think you may need
The panasonic does not have as long a zoom, but it serves my purpose and cropping  the final picture brings my subjects in beautifully
and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
These allow you to change so much of how the cameras functions in different lighting situations
Not at all worth $200
there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
Nikon S8100This camera is a pleasure to review and I can't say enough to describe what a superb instrument it is to use
It's  my  4th Lumix
i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
This camera has survived 6 months in the harsh desert environment of Afghanistan, even survived getting blown up without any problems
Nice
in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
I like the RED body although it shows fingerprints more than a black camera
this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
a great new use for that underutilized computer .
I didn't want to force it in, so I tried to power down and back up, but nothing I tried fixed the lens error
i highly recommend it .
I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
Great camera
it's a great camera
i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
It is very easy to use and has a good zoom on it
Blueberry with Nikon S8100
It's simple and basic, point shoot view
the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
I know it's a lot to ask from an entry-level camera, but even for basic use I am not comfortable with a camera that seems to miss 2 out of every 3 shots
Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
I bought this camera as a novelty item but expected something better than a marginal device
The instructions are 3 pages and do not explain the menu functions
I rather liked the old lazy way of the auto flash happening when I needed it
The software for your computers does not come on a disc, it must be downloaded from Sony
For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
Following that analogy this camera does a very good job, while making it easy for the driver/photographer
The main reasons are they allow you full manual controls and the interchangeable lenses
That is not a deal killer for me
Poor Design Choices
I know this is long-winded, but please bear with me
Simple, easy to use
I love this new camera and just started to use it when we went to our niece's wedding in Chicago
Recommend a SD card with at least a class 4 rating (the 1080p is a a lot of data to write)
Love it
WiFi and NFC (Near Field Communication) features for transferring files to your smartphone or tablet
Best Camera I've ever owned
best camera in its class by far
I ordered this camera with high hopes after seeing it was the #1 selling camera on Amazon at the time of purchase, and after reading many 4-star and 5-star reviews
I have been able to order some off Amazon but if I run out, I cannot just go to the store and get more
First of all
When it figures out the range the parentheses turns green
2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
The wheel at the back is OK, but not as inituitiveFPS is slow
The LCD has painfully low resolution
Great camera
Yo-This replaces my 'old' Lumix DMC-FZ60 and gives me a greatly improved wider and way longer lens distance with somewhat better picture quality
Quick to turn on and take a picture or just a moment pause before starting video capture
Save some money and buy an EOS T5i
Good telephoto and macro for internet,  and I am able to get photos of the dogs, so far I am very pleased
The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
With other cameras you hold down the button and it starts shooting (at whatever its shooting speed is such as 2
Perfect camera with a 10X zoom
Every person who has seen it work is amazed
I was looking for a camera with a great quality in the pictures and videos, pretty color and a camera that I could put in my purse
Moments later, I took a picture of my wife, and the camera automatically saved two versions of the picture I took: the original, and a separate one cropped to highlight my wife's face
You can just not zoom, and lock the AF to fix this problem
Great buy
You can not buy this camera thinking your going into a serious camera for any serious needs
And it's less than $60 with two extra batteries
I have to say this camera has performed way beyond my expectations
This camera is everything I was looking for
I've owned a few Nikons in the past, and am happy with this easy to use model at a pretty good price
I've been very reluctant to join the digital camera communitysince I've been an avid "legacy" photographer for most of mylife.
I have gone through over 10 different point and shoot cameras over the past 13 years
Writing in continuous mode can be very slow, and you can't shoot again until it's done--the wait is about 12 seconds at the highest resolution
Slow camera also
I consider this a major inconvenience that prospective buyers should be aware of
It's a great camera although like many new technologies it does far too many things for my purposes
I purchased this camera after seeing one in use on a trip to Costa Rica where it was excellent in capturing birds and monkeys in the forest canopy
No other point and shoot can top this camera
I wish it had broken a month earlier so that I could just return it to Amazon but now we have to deal directly with Nikon, which has been a pain
- File name conflicts
Great Little Camera
( you can only use this if you view your 3D pictures on a tv w 3 D capabilities ) but it is something I was not aware that it could do
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
Have not had a chance to try out the video in detail but the few shots I've taken look incredibly good
Very impressive
Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
PICTURE STABILIZED VERY WELL
With the camera that is
Sure you have to keep super steady but i find that to be a huge advantage over the L820 which had not so great low light pics and suffered from blurriness
I have determined that if you use this camera in flash mode, you have to remember to open the flash before you shoot by depressing the shutter halfway, WHICH YOU SHOULD DO ANYWAY TO SET THE FOCUS
The battery life is great, the picture quality is great, it is a complete package
Excellent camera
Will be shipping it out tomorrow and will update for your information when I have the refund in place
i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
This is a great product for the money, I needed an upgrade from my compact camera and this is pretty, lightweight and takes great pics
I have had a few Canon point and shoots that still operate fine and have never given me any problem
the only point and shoot that satisfy your photography
I have not yet tested the video so I cannot vouch for the quality there
I have 16 months old son who i took the best pictures of him with this incredible camera
else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately " fine **" picture quality  " image size : 1600 .
takes a little practice for those of us used to larger cameras
A dedicated Movie-button for instant recording, now on the top of the camera
It takes good pictures, but when recording video, it goes out of focus as soon as the focus is moving (in or out), and in a lot of cases it will not regain focus, the service department has giving me excuses and do not admit that the camera has a problem, that's why I recomend to check more reviews in regards of video before buying it, if you just want to take pictures, get a cheaper camera with the same capabilities as this one, you'll save alot
Also stock up on GOOD rechargeable batteries such Duracell
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
I like it
At first, I was concerned that this little camera would be what I was looking for to use
It was great
Simple fast control buttons for the most used functions
Flash location is a bit off, but I'll get used to holding it a little closer to the edges
I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
I suspect that the problem lies in the difference between CCD and CMOS sensors, although the FZ 47 was a CCD model and it was no better and much worse than the FZ 40
The Nikon Coolpix S8000 we have is a bit limited for that use
Great little inexpensive camera
The new night shooting capabilities are the absolute best I've seen in a compact camera
If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.
I will be trying a FujiFilm FinePix T550 next, which sells for the same price but has a 12x zoom, and (I expect) better image stabilization
the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
Plus the extra battery life is so useful
the quality is superb .
Would be nice to have a better LCD)No thumb wheel
My Mom is very careful of her things, and even with her being cautious of the camera, After 3 weeks, the shutter broke
She had a pervious version of this camera and loved it
doesnt show pic right when printed
Very nice and compact with the easy of use for features but almost all picture were blurry when used on stand or taken by camera in hand
Viewfinder works well asalternative
It was terrible
If you take a photo in portrait (vertical) orientation, you must rotate it MANUALLY
the service from the supplier was exceptional .
My husband and I travel quite a bit
With this camera it is much different, you hit the button once and it shoots 5 incredibly fast frames, then the whole camera locks itself up for 30seconds or so while it tries to process those images
we probably are doing something wrong but have not figured it out yet
The S8100 does most everything else very well though
The zoom lens was excellent in daylight, even when hand held
I think I might buy another one of these before somebody at Sony wakes up and figures out they made some kind of corporate mistake
You can't tell that it takes two pictures because it all only takes the time of a normal flash picture
My wife loves the camera, it is a bit tricky with the flash but you can get use to it
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
Great Superzoom
Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
The tripod mount is not aligned with the axis of the lens--it is offsetted to the right side of the camera by about 2
8 on the 50mm lens and being able to shoot 1080p video is really incredible
SLR/DSLR veterans will immediately recognize most of the basic functions provided by an infinity rotating  mechanical mode dial on the top of the camera
Okay camera, mediocre image quality, poor controls
It takes good pictures, they aren't the great pictures you've seen by really expensive professional cameras but I really can't complain about the clarity of any of my pictures
4, The images are not very sharp
this camera performs like i can not believe !
The first thing you notice is the grip
I would definitely recommend skipping this Panasonic for something else
There is no way to alter the file naming convention of PXXXXXXX
lots of great features even for a beginner
21 Days, one suitcase, I go light
I know whoever has this one is pleased with it
Image quality over the large zoom range is a huge plus for this product, even in low light conditions
i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .
When I saw the ad I was thrilled as I had checked it out before going to Amazon
Being a brand loyalist, I started with a Canon Powershot SX130IS
I already own a digital SLR camera and a 300mm zoom lens, but this approximates 600mm optical (1200mm digital) zoom, which is amazing
If thats their main con, they had to look awful hard to find it
Thanks
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
My still pictures of hummingbirds are praised by all who see them
the battery lasts way longer than any point and shoot
Love it
Like other recent cams, there's face-tracking to try to get snapshots "right" on the first try
has met our expectations
however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
the others were not good competitors at quick focus and holding the focus while hand held at the max zoom
The LCD is great, but annoying as all heck in bright conditions
The aggregated image was spectacular
Meh
good product
This is my 4th P&S in recent years and is the best
I doubt there is a better camera for the money
so why lie about it ?
the more i work with it , the more i love it !
Great Camera
My one complaint is that the screen is not moveable
unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
So far so good
The camera is so smart - is has a "Smile" feature that only when the subjects are smiling will it take
I'm not a professional photographer, but I do know my way around a camera
I am just a disabled dude who is fascinated with the art of taking pictures that appeal to me
Being as I know you need to use manual setting under the lights and I have yet to learn that the still shots at night were just as great, motion not so much but that's user error not the camera
i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
Very portable
There are plenty of adjustments to get great pictures and I guess if you want more adjustments then maybe you should think about a DSLR
Rocky
I absolutely love how the pictures turn out
Auto-focus is fast and accurate, burst shooting mode is also wonderful, as it greatly increases your odds of getting that perfect shot without any noticeable extra effort on your part
Now the best part of this camera is the 20 Megapixel CMOS sensor
easy to/ use
I love this camera it is what I expected  other cameras you get it is never what you expect that you get
still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
still waiting for coupon for 99% off second one
Just go with Picasa for photo organizing and light editing and Photoscape for more robust editing
Even in low light, I never had to use a flash
Takes excellent photos and is easy to use
I like the fact that it's a 30x zoom-yet is pocket-sized
the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
Check this one out for yourself for sure!
Attention to detail lacking
Best camera I've ever owned
Sticky backed photos perfect for scrapping
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
I can't wait for my next vacation
Unbelievable performance
It's not the smallest camera in the world so don't expect to go unnoticed if you put it in your pocket
This Christmas I purchased two items which were both trash
I take my camera everywhere.
the lowest price I could find for a repair was $200
I like the feel of this little camera, sturdy not plastic
Great night shots but washed out in bright daylight
Almost Perfect
; love the color
Like you need a separate bag just to carry this (exaggerating a bit)
I am very pleased with my purchase.
Only draw back is its not water proof so now I have to get another after dropping it in the ocean
Primarily I leave it on intelligent auto focus, and have no worries
I don't use WiFi or smartphone functions
as it was such a great concept
It can just be a toy, not a digital camera
Just shoot and click
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
Nikon coolpix has some nice desired features and is easy to use
First of all I am not a professional photographer graduated from a university, but know a little more than basic concepts
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
Sit in your pocket and take pictures
Super pictures and nice feature set all at a reasonable price
But it did not last very long before I got the dreaded "lens malfunction"
Great for the money - close ups with flash it too much some times
The 'fun' part of the camera is printing images on the paper which double as stickers - while it is neat to be able to print images immediately, the glitz wears off once you realize that the images fade very rapidly - I took some pictures of employees at work when I first bought the camera and now the images are just blue blobs that resemble the employees
Great for Shots on the Go
If you are an amateur tired of point-and-shoot and want to start playing with interchangeable lens, shatter speed, aperture, field depth or at least heard about those terms, go for it
Great HD movies, great pictures even at the lower pixels
It makes a great photo printer for pictures taken with other cameras
If you don't care about image quality, it's a great camera
that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
My S8100 is being returned to Amazon for a refund as I have to give up on Nikon
It seems to me any user who elects to use RAW and manipulate thereafter would find the requirement to save in JPEG as well an unnecessary annoyance
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
It does have a useful, though low-resolution panorama mode for those who don't want to make the effort to combine multiple photos using image processing software
Would recommend for beginners or someone who wants good simple shots of their vacation
I also like the fact I can attach an awesome zoom lens for very close and personal pictures
Takes some really killer macro photos and zoomed photos and thus far I am impressed
however the special features are wondrous
I thought little of it, and tried to reinstall the drivers through the device's preferences, but found that the option was unavailable for some reason
Instead, it is a nice looking but fairly vanilla point and shoot
) Combined with the fact that one has to constantly switch between LCD and viewfinder by pressing a button, the low quality of the LCD and the viewfinder (the latter being horrible) makes taking pics with this camera a frustrating experience
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
Around 50c a print it's cheaper than film polaroids
In low light situations, you might want to use a tripod if you wish to avoid noise at high ISOs since the over exposure shot in the sequence could be considerably slower than the under exposure at the other end of the EV spectrum
it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
This is a great camera that makes excellent pictures
I think Nikon put a really good sensor in this camera, creating a balanced overall package rather than just inflating the megapixel and zoom rating the way some brands do
Because of the low light it automatically took a series of 7 or 8 shots
Awesome Camera
It is an excellent device
however i realized that when in a situation where i knew a flash may be needed, i could just open it up
Very hard to see the picture in bright sunlight
One minor  quibble: even though the model of this camera is "A3000", if you want to find information about it on Sony's support site, you should now that is known there by the model number "ILCE-3000')
I didn't want all the different lenses to mess with
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
Can anyone give your opinion in the difference of cameras and photo quality of both the SX50 and FZ70,, at the 20mm and 1200mm
I haven't noticed any noise and have taken about 20 hours of video
My daughter took it on a trip and even tho she left it mostly on auto - the pictures and video were stunning
Pictures come out so clean and clear even in the dark lighting (zero light) at night
I was buying a camera solely for still photography, and, if that's what you are looking for, there is no better in this price class
He has had fun with this one
If you shoot RAW, you could squeeze a lot out of the A3000 CMOS sensor using Adobe Lightroom
The zoom feature works great, the macro mode is great, the low light function works great (you probably will need the flash only in a dark room)
So the shutter causes the short to tell the flash to reset, but not receiving the command to fire it, strange
The charger of the battery didn't work, so I need bought a new charger
However, everything about it (except maybe the AF) seems sluggish in comparison to the Nikon, though that may not be an entirely accurate nor objective statement
I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
As compared to other point and shoot cameras, the quality and detail is hands down better
This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
It is lightweight and compact given that huge piece of glass on the front
this is great for trips afar
ConclusionThis is a low cost camera that takes great pictures
I couldn't even tell it was a real estate sign from where I stood, but the photo I took is extremely sharp and clear
Several cameras are far superior in performance and features at similar price points
the quality of the pictures is so inconsistent
I had heard good things about Nikons and I made the switch when my wife lost our little Canon point and shoot
This camera was purchased  for my  daughter for  fourteenth  birthday
The price was the best I've seen anywhere
But it'd print one picture and then say load paper even though there was an entire pack just loaded in
The second big difference is the battery
I love it and the fact that the photos have an easy peel back making it fun for collage boards
It is sort of like an A37 that uses E mount lenses instead of Sony/Minolta auto focus mount lenses
I use this on a daily purpose for work but would not like to have it for personal use
they look fantastic .
This Nikon Coolpix L830 takes four AA batteries so it is a bit of a battery hog but, I feel the batteries last longer
it was a great deal
But also because of its smaller size, it becomes possible to design a super zoom camera with an astonishing zoom range
i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
But the reliability of this camera SUCKS
Come on Nikon
I was absolutely bowled over by the quality of the photographs
Then we purchased an FZ150 and the detail is excellent
so easy to use, its very comfortable in the hand, it feels quite friendly if that makes any sense :P  The rubbery spots are very convenient for gripping it and taking pictures with one hand
If only it could fit in my pocket
BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.
Gave it five stars
The whole idea behind this camera is "magazine quality images" for as little money as possible
I was hoping for this digital Polaroid to have a better printing thatn the traditional, but it was not the case
Not clear and crisp
I have had full size dslr and slr Nikons all my life
I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
let me say first off that it works great in full auto mode  iA mode
I was able to take lots of great pics & print the picture out & give them out to the guests at the party as presents :) When you buy this camera buy a SD card too so you can have lots of pics saved to camera
It's easy to make the photos
I wrote another review and this is the update.
Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
Excellant Camera
So far, my experiences have been super
S8100 is a winner
In this age of modern electronics, the camera itself is a plastic coated, clunky, over sizepiece of junk with what appears to be a plastic lens
However, for less than 400 bucks in the US, I think it's a  good deal
I was able to get sharp hand held images at 60X zoom most of the time
You can also take pictures during videoing
The long zoom is also a big plus when taking wildlife shots
I do like having the saturation button at my fintertips though so maybe i'm really not on the fence
HD video: One of my favorite things about this line of cameras is you can shoot video at 1080p which is very high-resolution and looks great on high definition televisions and even on YouTube
Others:1200mm is possible with hand-held, but you need good light and at least 1/200 shutter speed
I'm taking pictures like a pro these days
I am used to pulling out my camera, hitting the on button and shooting quickly
Focusing: yes when I zoom in and try to focus closer than the lens physically can get it won't focus (10x has to be something over 10' or so)
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .
The zoom is outstanding - optical to x60 excellent and the digital iZoom doubles this with no loss in image size and manageable loss in quality, there is more digital zoom on top of this but then noise really starts to become unacceptable
+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
-Comes with some rad software to help with editing
Excellent camera
its cool - but photos are too small
with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
I guess if i bought a camera with a 10 mp, I shouldnt expect much
While this camera has 16MP like my other micro43 cameras (OM-D EM5, GX7, so forth), they are not in the same class, so don't compare this camera to any mirrorless interchangeable or DSLR
I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
So no putting this camera in the back pocket of tight jeans, which is something I want do often
This is not suppose to be a high end, high resolution camera  - it is suppose to be fun, instant and a great way to have some quick pics
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
(7) Quick startup time
I needed something less complicated than what I had before so this is amazing for me
So much more you can do than just pictures
Fairly simple to operate & it's not bulky
Much better to have separate controls for these 3 MAJOR variants, or at a minimum, a separate button to switch between purposes
Perfect for our intended use
Great camera smaller and lighter than a DSLR and much better quality pictures than a pocket camera
Great camera, good price
The pictures are great
and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
Better image quality and fully fix the noise from SX260 video
I haven't done many people shots with flash yet , so I cannot comment of reports of the flash washing out subjects
My wife and I did a fair amount of research and we kept arriving at this particular camera--point and shoot w/ more than adequate zoom,mp's, and it takes a photo quickly--the major problem w/ old camera
I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
The zoom is amazing
came close on this one
telling people over and over again to "watch your finger because the flash pops up" got really old
The results are exceptional, the videos are super clear and the audio is great
It takes sharp pictures, is easy to use and lets you via the viewfinder electronically or the LCD
The user interface is extremely intuitive and the picture quality is outstanding
Only problem - wireless syncing with computer and smartphone for remote shooting
The lens extends to provide 60x optical zooming, coupled with superior image stabilizing firmware that I find myself snapping away
we were looking forward to many holiday pictures so what a bummer that was
I read this camera's review and I though it was a no-brainer
A very nice camera
However, it is a waste of time to go through those modes by just using the stiff buttons
I've really enjoyed it
i definately recommend a large memory card .
It is a lot better the the previous camera that I bought and sent back to Amazon
I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
COM LIKELY THINKS I'VE GONE STARK RAVING BONKERS - I GOT THIS & THREE OTHER CAMERAS IN A WEEKS TIME
It is fairly light and the design is good, a good grip and feels balanced
Love the 30X zoom
but as time goes on, I want to spend less time on all of that and more time on composition
This camera did not live up to my expectations
This camera is truely superb.
This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
I did buy it before all the cameras went on sale for Christmas, and i was bummed i didnt wait
I'm a bargain shopper
Polaroids itself are affordable because they are built to be a bit less sturdy than a regular camera
I am not the world's best photographer and I wasted many an instant camera in high school due to my lack of skills
Definitely recommend
now what about the flash problem ?
Excellent
I've only had the camera in my hands since yesterday and will add more impressions as I get deeper into it but except for the lousy on/off switch I'm quite impressed at this point
Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.
The indoor pics are not dark
Again, the picture quality is fantastic for a compact point & shoot
More importantly, the camera suits my needs perfectly, takes great pictures
I love this camera, I can zoom and take pictures of all the beautiful flowers, birds, bees, butterflies
It seemed to recharge quickly using an electrical outlet but took a couple hours using the USB plugged into a laptop
Very good and reliable cameraQuality of picture is so nice and easy to useNice body too Thanks sony
Wow, what a zoom
just point and shoot
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
Panasonic website shows Leica lens which is NOT on FZ70
Best Camera
It is very fast in writing, reading, shutter action, on and off, and preview of picture taken(Quick Option)
Noisy and grainy
Unsatified with picture quailty
I wanted to like this camera ,but it does not come close to the FZ200 in photo quality
Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
8 allows you to shoot at faster shutter speeds in low light situations because the circle in the lens allows more light to pass through because of the lower aperture
The Sony A3000 is an interesting animal; although it looks like a DSLR, it's a mirrorless camera with a built-in electronic viewfinder, so you could think of it as a low-cost version of a NEX-5R fitted with its EVF option
This Sony A3000 is kind of what you see is what you get
after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
It wastes storage space in the SD card
Given the quality of the photos and video I am shooting with the SX700, the effectiveness of the image stabilization, and the camera's portability, I don't hesitate to take the SX700 when going out for the day or traveling
My husband who has never been a picture taker even started taking the camera from me
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
I am told by Nikon that cameras currently being manufactured will have the new updated firmware, but that those on the market now will need the fix
Don't get me wrong this is a great instant print camera, but it just didnt work like an old polaroid it was more like a camera/compact camera printer, you can choose the pictures you want to print, and view them
Its a bit large and heavy for a point and shoot, but it still fits my pants pocket
In the meantime, I've missed having the camera for my family vacation - ugh
which slows down the speedThe most unacceptable issue of this camera, is the image quality it provides
They also slowed the zoom speed down (to reduce noise?)
I love it
Technically, it belongs to a category of cameras known as "ILCE" ( "interchangeable lens digital camera)
I wish all mirrorless cameras had such grip
So, in summary
I've tried tweaking the settings a little bit and choosing various scenes but the pictures just look bad
Camera for Cabo
That zoom is amazing
But this Lumix FZ70 is over the top good
So the technique with the Sony in-camera HDR is to play with that the center photo exposure of the three that will be taken
Its a good camera, have an excelent resolution and extraordinary zoom, i hope dont have inconvenients and continue using by a good time this camera
I am done with Nikon products
Note: when you first look at the digital display of a picture, you might question the quality, but when you actually upload it to a computer, the picture quality really cleans up and the pics are great
So why would you choose the T5 over the SL1? It really all comes down to the handling
Pictures come out vertu nice and crisp
The images are not at all noise-free: it is ridiculous to market them as such
The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
start up is so quick ñ
It took me some time to learn how to use it, because a lot of buttons have many functions
I've been looking for a great superzoom camera for several years, tried the Canon SX50 which is very good as well but settled on the Lumix
Really jumps out there for zoom lens with no distortion
whoa .
Since you need to be mindful of the flash placement, holding this camera is awkward further exasperating the issue
But for the rest of us, this FZ70 is an extraordinary camera, even though its long-telephoto lens speed is less than that of the FZ150 or 200
The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
Rather than compare specifications, let me just say what I love about this camera
Best camera ever
Really disappointing
This camera has a rechargeable LI-ON battery, and this is an improvement over my older camera that uses AA batteries
however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
Great Camera
It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
2) Battery life not so good when printing multiples
the powershot g3 is a great camera .
Even at 120x, I see very little grain and surprisingly little chromatic distortion
I am trading in my FZ150 and replacing it with this unit
He loved it
Also there is no battery charger that comes with the camera
I've had a heck of a time with this camera
But oh well, at least the EVF has one redeeming feature
The package didnt contain the leather pouch or 4GD SDHC card as promised at the checkout
My example of the FZ-70 took noticeably soft, blurry pictures particularly at the end of its zoom range
Excellent camera
More capability here than I would expect for this price
I had to go into my settings because digital zoom was disabled on my camera
I should get some amazing nature pictures
I thought I'd thoroughly researched replacement brands/models, and this Nikon S8100 was my best choice
I've shot everything from sports car road races to retirements to scenery with great success and carrying this 1 lb 7
Once I play with the settings just right it takes amazing pictures
You won't regret it for one minute
BAD PRINT QUALITY
At times its a bit bright (so you really have to play with settings)
Excellent Camera for the Price
Pictures and video look very good, better than my other cameras
The pictures were soft and the lens was slow to focus
I have tried the same settings that I use on my other cameras and was not pleased with the results at all
I would be the first to say, "Canon has done it again," were I not also an owner of the ill-fated sx280
WTF???Cannot believe Nikon came out with such a bad product
I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
I have an NEX 7, and this was bought so that i could keep my telephoto on my neck while i had a wide angle
also , the lens cap design is flawed .
I've only been playing with it for a few minutes now and I already like it a lot
Excellent quality
I do have only 1 issue
Crossing my fingers the lens doesnt start acting up, i will update my review if anything goes wrong
Excellent Product strongly suggested
The resolution of both the EVF viewfinder and the rear LCD is lower than that of a lot of competitors' cameras, but you have to expect some corner cutting for this price
why ?
When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
1 MP, you can't find it anywhere else
I have owned two of these, in black and chrome/platinum colors
Didn't like it
This camera is well worth the price
. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software " nikon view " which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
However, the manual says you cannot change the zoom while taking video, so I want to verify that and make sure the focus keeps up
The low light image quality is far better than all other point n shoot cameras and significantly better than those &#34;fit in the jeans pocket&#34; cameras
The menu is very intuitive and user friendly
What I was not crazy about:-The GPS tagging is mostly a gimmick; it actually depends on an app on your phone, which records GPS position and date/time
The mechanism does seem very sensitive to dust
But when we're LOOKING at a beautiful photo taken with (for instance) this camera's wide-angle lens, we're using our central vision to view the photo
it was obvious that the Panasonic was not good enough, the Samsung NX2000 was on the edge, and both could not be compared to the DSLR
Great quality
Very poor picture quality
Well the prayers were answered because when we looked at the pictures later on a screen I could actually see, they turned out super crisp
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
Good Photo Quality
I am excited to give it as a Christmas gift and capture some memories with it
Will be posting it with a return notification
Affordable and nice features
Otherwise fantastic camera
Don't forget that, for those that complain about the quality from Any camera, it's a no-brainer
I had a Canon TSi for 5 years and recently my large zoom lens stopped working
i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
(I have owned many canons and a panasonic lumix
It was well worth the wait for my red camera
A Beginners Dream Camera
Not able to sit close
Will try another brand next time
3, It uses 4 AA batteries
A lot of hype is made because this FZ70 takes photos using the RAW format, which Panasonic says is superior to the JPEG format
I'm very unhappy with this camera
reason for two ?
The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
Great camera
I have the Sony a99, RX1, and RX100m2
Articulating screens are not necessary for me and I'm not overly impressed with touch screens
Added 9/24/13 this is by far an amazing camera~~ You need to read the manual which is in PDF form to grasp everything you can do with this
The T5 is lighter
They were never great but
this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
I sat in my kitchen and took a picture of one ornament on the tree in the family room, and I could see the clarity as if I were right in front of it
recently , i attended a " flyball " competition
I will return to using Canon cameras as they are more durable and of higher quality
Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
We've had this for almost a year now and the photo quality has been very good
:(I just recently sent it in, after I dropped it and the lens wouldn't retract
The zoom also bothered me due to A LOT of shakiness, which I understand happens at the highest zoom and being hand held, but again, I didn't experience that much of it with my previous camera
No blow outs of over-exposing
The photo here definitely doesn't do it justice
Ok, so you aren't going to get super duper mega fine picture quality, but it isnt bad either
The one I have is still under warranty, but after reading other people's experiences with Nikon service, I don't know if it is worth digging up the receipt and trying to get a replacement
We purchased it at our local retailer and had a good experience with it
Pictures are great the rapidfire feature is very good
Expectations of the zoom were probably too high for a point and shoot
I took a couple of pictures with this came and they came out so beautiful
Awesome
The huge viewscreen tilts and swivels to make it easy to take a pic of something low to the ground (resulting in lots of right up in their faces cat pictures) and its big and bright
The thing about the T3i is that it's all around a better camera and even more advanced than this one
Love it
We live in a rural area with lots of flowers and critters, and they are usually my subjects (unless our granddaughter is around)
personally i dont know why anyone would use this
i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
Never a problem and they all produce excellent pictures
Which I guess is OK because they turn out bad anyway ;-)Finally
maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
The body is all plastic expect for the hot shoe
you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
Great pictures just forget the Wi Fi
Great Point and Shoot
Some have complained of battery life, but I found them to last a really long time
The lens gets a little soft in the long end
The point and shoot capability is good
may be later I can have a better oppinion on it
Keep the camera
Its awful
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
They all came out superb
Yes, as some of the reviewers have pointed out, there are some design issues maybe, some things that could be better, but overall, I have been very pleased
Not the Same
this is not the same thing as a film camera .
very good
]  Also helps to learn more on how to take pictures so you will not blame the camera for your failures
Worth every penny
Great camera
I was not happy that the camera would not accept any of my 6 cards
I am no professional photographer so I am happy I can get a grat picture with the touch of a button and I don't have to play with the settings or anything
I was surprised to see that it was built in China because my FZ-7 was built in Osaka Japan and somehow I had been led to believe that this series was built in Japan
It fits comfortably in my hands, and it's easy to use
In stock items shipped free always arrive in less than 5 days but since this one did not ship I may not see it until next week
battery seems to last long so far
Kind of flimsy and picture quality is not amazing but it's fun to have for a ladies night or fun date night
This camera is great
it takes 4 regular 2AA batteries, which I like, as its quick and convenient, and I was able to pop in my old SD card and get to work taking photos
The picture quality is comparable to and possibly even better than from the Canon 16MP D5100 that costs more than twice as much
i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
Awesome camera
I look forward to taking pictures from my window of deer and critters that wander into the far reaches of the yard
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
I sold my Canon A640 and replaced it with this and I am very pleased with the sharpness of the photos
Great Camera
I spent a lot of time reviewing compact cameras prior to settling on this one
Got this camera the day before we left on vacation
Nice pics
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
I looked at the P530 and L830, and Canon SX510
Reasonable size (fits in pocket)
The Nikon Coolpix l830 is awesome, we have been having fun with this camera
my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
This is a camera that is generally intuitive to use (and what is not intuitive is *excellently* described in an included user guide (and a supplemental creative handbook)
6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes .
The come out with a blue-green hue that almost resembles that "vintage" look, but actually comes off as terrible quality from a sub-par and over-priced product from what used to be the most trusted name in instant cameras
Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
As to the dreaded lens error message, you must get into the habit of removing the lens cover before turning the camera on
not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
They are absolutely amazing
And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
The gold color is perfect
Great Pics
overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.
&#34;  The photos, although exactly as described, are really, really small
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
Overall, it is a fairly good camera for the price
By all other reviews they rank these two camera's pretty close and that would've sent me the other way had I done my research better
feels solid in hand .
A fine light camera
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
That's a big difference
It will be awhile before I get to use all the features that this camera has to offer
I ultimately returned it
i set the camera to the " manual " mode for one main reason :
The camera has a solid feel to it
My wife enjoys taking videos when we travel
Worth every penny and easy to use for the novice
A good thing is you only print pictures you like
and of course this camera lets you bracket exposures in a traditional sense as well
What a waste of time & money -- are the pictures worth it?  I probably could have gotten shots just as nice from a Canon or Kodak (and will in the future)
I was also able to get wonderful short 30 second videos of the wedding ceremony
Just now able to use my new camera after waiting a few days to go buy another card so the camera would work
A great upgrade for me, all my family pictures, inside/outside are much better
Sharper pictures.
the friend lovedd ita little bulkier than expected
Would highly recommend getting one
moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
This camera was way too expensive to have such poor quality
I was able to drag the manual off the CD ROM into a new file on my desktop, so I don't have to use the CD to read it
I did adjust a few of the setting for the auto mode to get increased consistency and more true to life images
This is not comparable at all, in any way, to DSLR
I have my Fujifilm Instax so, I'll just stick with that
My Samsung S5 was used for all our panoramic shots
Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16
I'm a very occasional photographer, so this camera meets my needs very well
I doubt you will find its equal without spending at least twice as much
I enjoy all the options and the zoom is spectacular
again intuitive
I was able to shoot at max zoom and get good results hand holding the camera
This one is tops in my books
There is a thumb grip in the upper right hand corner to help not drop it
Battery life seems to be very good as I have been using it
Back to Canon
The bulge on the right-hand side of the camera provides a comfortable grip like DSLR cameras and will allow you to shoot better and with more stability
Could also be improved in low light autofocus locking on at higher zoom levels in incandescent lighting
What astounds me about this camera is the low price and the image quality
First of all, the plastic this camera made from feels so cheap
Not bad at all
It has the form factor of a DSLR with a competitive APS-C sensor but otherwise is deficient in comparable build quality although at the price point it is somewhat understandable
There is a problem with the USB/AV port on the camera
NOW THIS CAMERA IS EASY TO USE AND TAKES VERY GOOD AND CLEAR PICTURES
Edge sharpness was better than my Alpha 57, but saturation looked more video-like than film-like
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
or a T mount adapter
The build quality is great
I bought this camera for my wife and she's loving it
It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot.
Makes very good pictures
Very happy with this purchase, especially for $200
Sounds like they have some lemons out there
This camera that takes high resolution pictures, vivid colors, is reasonably priced
getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
I recommend this camera for everybody who wants to capture best pictures
they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
learning how to use it will not take very long .
I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
Lots of choices and customization's available
I am impressed, and very glad I got this camera
The prints are pretty good, though definitely not film quality
This was the only camera I played with that met the criteria
It is really nice and pretty compact for the amount of zoom it offers
I returned it for a full refund due to be so disappointed
I can tell you that the 1080p video is amazing
For the price is an extremely great camera
Photos were less sharp in many cases compared to some of my other cameras, mostly due to the aggressive noise reduction
The latter plastic housed component also may present some problems for eye-glass wearers
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
I am shooting the neighbors flowers one petal at a time
Blah camera
All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.
Great camera with excellent features and easy to use
This is probably due to the actual number of lenses and distance the lenses are able to extend from the camera itself
I read reviews and it met all my expectations
negatives
Nikon compact camera
What really impressed me was the low light performance which is no doubt due the larger ccd
And the quality of the pictures printed from it are not very good
Additionally, I have yet to get a diopter setting with it I am happy with and rear positioned control setting wheel seems comparably minimalist compared to others I have used
After a couple of weeks so far so good
An outstanding camera at an excellent price
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
And the HD video (720p) is very good for a camera of this size
Big thing is, this is a lot of camera for $300 bucks or so, and that 20mm wide end is pretty rare and a nice plus on top of that long zoom
) Even with the zoom extended completely I am able to get decent pictures
Couldn't be happier
Excellent point and shoot, with 1 star removing flaw
Your photos would come out darker if you're zooming in far out subject on cloudy day but with 34x zoom you should be using a tripod and taking photo when there is suffrciant light behind you and onto the subject, camera does compensate for shake but that is more effective when you're taking a portrait but when you're zoning in 30 times even a slight hand shake will multiply 30 times
in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
Now as I operate everything I can't understand what it was that was so complicated for me
I have had Canon and Olympus products and they do not even compare
I'm sure others will be perfectly happy with it but it's not the camera for me
Now six months later the lens error has happened again
I love the great, awesome 3 inch 921,000 dot high resolution screen
I was looking for a camera a long time ago, but I didn't know wich one to buy
It is digital but also can switch to the view finder with ease and takes great pictures
Best camera in it's price range
I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
It is too simple for such a camera
If you want a bridge between a digital 35mm and the little point and shoot or cell phone cameras this Canon SX700 should be considered
just point and shoot and the photos were great .
It is so very easy to use and has a lot of awesome features allowing you to take some really nice shots that would normally only be available for a camera that is much more expensive
And the color of picture is not as beautiful as sony
A snap on/off cover would be a better option for lens cap
It fits in your pocket.
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
but i guess that's how it would beit's a polaroid for crying out loud
Outdoor/well lit pictures look good
It's not entirely on par with a proper DSLR, but they're getting there
The majority of my pictures are nature - birds, flowers, scenery
If you really want a good price camera go for at least a EOS Rebel T5i
Pros:  Light weight bridge camera with super wide angle and ridiculous zoom
But I am still very pleased with the camera and give it a top rating
Nothing protects the lens, so I would suggest getting the case
This camera is amazing
Another lens failure
I am not a professional photographer, I don't even qualify as an "aficionado"
Low light video is good but the more you zoom the less light you get (gee
There were certain features I knew I wanted but didn't know if I could get them all in the same camera
It is amazingly stable and sharp with little noise in side, and simply fantastic outside
Wish it had a view finder, but most point and shoots don't
Tests shots of clouds were better than average in that regard as compared to many compacts and P&S; models
Bad prints
My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
Zoom is 60x for optical and another 60x for digital (120x)
Crisp pictures, easy to you use, and the battery life is the best I've come by
HD makes it a step above many others along with facial recognition and low light/nighttime controls
one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , " actually we do n't ship on saturdays " .
The zoom focus was sluggish and super slow (it was not supposed to be this way)
In bright light, the camera excels
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
got a great deal from a reputable seller .
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
Sharp clear photos at all zoom levels
I am looking for another megazoom; it will probably be a Canon
Besides I have an adapter that allows alpha lenses on the NEX size bodies
good
When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
The body is very cheap
This is the best camera in its class, that is, the best compact zoom
2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
This camera is harder to hold still for a quick shot than my little sony
This camera does take awesome pictures though and is definitely fun
Uploading them to the computer is a breeze too
Takes excellent photos and is easy to use
A step down ring 55-52 will not work at the widest angles (~20mm-24mm)
It does not compare well with DSLRs that I've used, but that is an unfair compariso
The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
I think the Panasonic FZ150/FZ200 has the best image quality for the bridge cameras but there is not a huge difference
It grabs a quick picture when we need it
This camera does the trick at portability and takes great pictures for a hand-held pocket sized camera
jpg and the dslr shooting
Of course there are some issues if you &#34;pixel-peep&#34; at the image 1:1 on your screen, but that's not how the image is going to be viewed
It has many features and digital video recording at 1080
great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
that meant even less light and just as much action .
My dad has the previous gen
The screen is bright and clear and the movie feature is easy to use and takes awesome video
My son, as a surprise gift, bought my wife and myself tickets aboard a tour ship that went out into the SF harbor to watch the America's Cup
It actually takes a picture without flash (so as to capture the light behind you) and then takes a flash picture
Love the zoom
We have had very good luck taking indoor pics in an auditorium
Pretty much in the top ten list in this price range
When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
My biggest issue is limp flash
I began the review at five stars, but dropped it to three because of printing issues
I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
NOT even 1080 x 800 resolution
2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
This is a perfect high pixel camera with telephoto lens for travel
Sometimes detail with noise is more palatable than loss of detail and less noise
Although not as small as the cameras he is used to, it fits nicely in a pocket
It's a bit bulky, but I like how it feels in my hands
My Canon EOS Rebel T5 - love it
After my grand daughter dropped and broke the lens and telescope, I put it away and just used my phone for the past year
The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.
The palm of your hand makes full contact with the camera
The flash is powerful for a pop-up, as with all cameras the learning curve for indoor shots is a bit steeper
It was able to satisfactorily resolve some geese about 50 yards away when zoomed all the way (both with the lens and with the zoom function in playback)
messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
The owners manual is way too brief and doesn't give enough details on how to use all the features or easy ways to access them
the moveable lcd screen is great .
I delt with it because the shots were good and I spent 250
Full HD 1920 x 1080, 60 fps progressinve movie recording in a popular MP4 format
3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
It couldnt even do good recognition sometimes leaving the pictures blurry
I just got my new camera, I am not a expert in the matter, but I am VERY HAPPY  with this Nikon camera
All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
I'm nobody's photographer, but just about every shot I take with this camera comes out blurry
I definitely recommend the 50mm linked above as it helps learning the manual controls of this camera
-Sometimes it takes a while focus when its in AUTO mode (only during lower light conditions)
The camera charged and came to life very efficiently
it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
The prints are small and have a sticky back but color reproduction is not always acceptable* (sometimes bueish, sometimes pinkish)
I graded the Panasonic with  3 stars, as it is reasonably priced for whatever you get
I don't really care about this, but it's kinda fun and is a bonus
This holds for both for automatic and for various manual settings
It took me a bit of time getting acclimated to the idiosyncrasies of the camera after having gotten accustomed to my Sony but since then, wow, am I a happy camper
The image quality is great
Its very expensive from Canon ($35+), I have a cheap knock-off that lasts almost as long and cost $6
Pictures are great
Lower the Noise Reduction Setting for Sharper Pics
i'm really disappointed with the quality of the flash, but without it, the camera is good
being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
(maybe in a few years?)So, I wanted a camera that could deal with low light, shoot fast, start up fast, shoot again fast, and be around 200 bucks
For the features, this camera is hard to beat, the automatic scenes do what they are supposed to quick, and easy
This is really too bad because the camera has so many great features and works for 95% of the photos I want to take
The picture quality is fine for my needs (snapshots, travel photos, birding shots) and the camera is light enough to keep in my backpack
Light, very light
Certainly fine for this price range and intended uses
I am on the fence about the settings buttons and not having a rotating selector switch
With extreme shots, only very minor chromatic aberration and have not noted issues blooming
Great Camera
Balanced
This camera is great for a novice like myself
The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
The pictures are kind of blurry after printing
It's not a macro camera by any means, but I've been happy with butterfly photos taken far enough away to not startle the insect
My husband thought I was getting way to much confidence in the zoom, but my pictures turned out great especially for a point and shoot
if you are insterest in good pictures and don't have the skills to be a profesional taking pictures this s the camera you need
The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
No matter how I think I can slice it, fundamentally, I am a point and shoot user who is more interested in looking like I have some skills rather than actually devoting the time, effort and dedication required to refine my limited abilities with higher level equipment
Bought it, returned it
Great camera
a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on " normal " resolution .
makes for a great toy out with friends or parties
With the SX700, I am getting very good photos and video, it is always ready to shoot both close ups and distant object, no lens change necessary, and it is light weight and easy to carry
This cam is a very good electronic device
I miss having a grid,may be
i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
However, I can't go halfway around the world and lose priceless memories to a camera that somehow easily gets scratched or won't operate without doing voodoo
I'm a mom of two small children, I work full-time and I'm a grad student - I don't have time to spend making my pictures better with software
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
You won't regret buying this C=
It should be impossible to do that but with some extra bracing, the sharp images were close to all of the time
The outdoor ones were better than the indoor ones
I have to decide whether I'm going with the FZ60 or a Cannon
However, not perfect, and it could be substantially improved
Ineke Baker-Adan
You'll have the usual gamut of full auto, full manual and many combinations in between
I like the view finder - sometimes it works better than the display - especially in bright light
- BATTERY LIFE: It's relatively, well, miserable
Fantastic fun easy to use camera that brings fun to any event
The camera I received was clearly the same product shown online, but I feel like I am reviewing an entirely different product than the one I expected to receive
I received the SD500 on Monday, charged the battery and inserted the SD card that came with it, took a few pictures and waited until Thursday when the 2 GB SD card came that I had ordered.
The camera is great for what it is
my old camera can take 40 photos in seconds this one seems to have a lag when continuous shooting
pets and flowers, and every single picture is beautiful
Even with the max zoom the pictures turn out great
I have just played with it, learning to use it, so far it has been great, suggest a tripod for the extra long zoom shots
I do nature photography
I'll still take my jean pocket worthy Canon SX280HS with me but will use this for excursions and killing time on ship
After taking a few photos, the mechanism for processing the photos seems to be on the blink and I am getting a white band of mottled colour on the lower half inch of the photo
you can see the moon and every detail perfectly
highly recommended
My bff got this as a christmas gift and rated it very high
But, based on the reviews from consumer reports Nikon was a top camera so I thought I would try it out
canon SX50 vs FZ70
the canon g3 .
I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
After owning this camera for a month and have taken hundreds of pictures and many movies I can say its a great camera for under $200
easy to upload and print photos
you need good lighting in the room or outside in order to have a half decent picture
Nothing looked dark very clear
one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
Quality is amazing
Sure, it's cheap, but I've recently seen dslr's selling for $50-70 more (new)
It does however tell you when you should pop the flash up
Terrific little camera
Very nice camera, only problem is a common problem with all cameras that use only a monitor screen and no viewfinder is that they are very difficult to see on a sunny day
the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
It's great for those school programs when the lighting is dark
The things that jumped out at me most:+Excellent image quality from a proper sensor, little noise at 1600 ISO or lower
The resolution of the close-ups is fantastic and the zoom, non-flash shots are also fabulous
The dial is stiff and clicks into place (but doesn't lock into place)
I don't understand why an in stock item did not ship
Not as good as the fz200 but you don't pay as much for this camera either
But this is not much of a factor unless really zoomed
00 so I began my search for a new camera
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
The plastic cover for these outlets is very flimsy and feels like it's going to break off everytime they are moved to plug a cable in
Having the Digic II chip helps a lot.
While manual settings will give the best results, the auto settings were pretty intelligent
Love this camera
I found a rubber hood with a 55mm thread outside (that fits to the camera thread) and 55mm inside, so you can attach a filter to protect the lens
I lost so many lens caps in the past:{One tiny thing I am not crazy about: having to pop up the flash
I now have two of these A3000's
Pros: Battery life seems fair, makes excellent pictures and is very user friendly
I may come back and update more as I have more time with this camera
Obviously I didn't expect much, but I am very pleased
Astonishingly even at 60x the pictures come out clear WITHOUT a bi or tripod
The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
It is small, lightweight and very easy to handle with one hand
So Fun
Rating the 8100
One small thing that I do wonder about is the lens
The plastic feel is a nice strong plastic so it keeps the feeling of it being novelty while feeling of good quality
UGH
But the best part is the video
No memory card is provided
Also, the inability of the camera to switch back and forth to the finder automatically can be a little aggravating when you have to press the Finder/LCD button up top
Once I picked up my SD card, I really went crazy snapping shots
I've got a couple of digital cameras.
Incredible sensor
First camera she is reading the manual to see what else it can do
The menu system is laughably archaic but, it does the job
One other plus point is the start up speed - I would estimate at approx 1 second
I've gotten some of the best pictures of my family from this camera
Oh well
if the lense is on or the batteries are low, the camera freezes and you have to turn it off and on
so you can hear the stereo sound better
Other complaints in reviews have to do with the location of the flash - not a problem for me
These are considered "budget" or beginner DSLR's but in actuality, they are packed with features and unless you are a pro, you won't need much more in a DSLR
And going with a higher end G series would defeat the purpose of "cheaper and lighter"
I use this in my classroom
"  So, I am thinking that I will spread the word about our $180 worthless piece of junk that really didn't take good pictures anyway
The picture quality is excellent and the camera well balanced
This is the workhorse of a point and shoot camera
Beware
Also took lots of night shots in France, and they were also great
Video operation is straight forward and the finished product is great
When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
The zoom on this camera is impressive
The L830 has to be manually released to function, but knowing that
I took over 400 pictures at the wedding and I cannot say enough good things about this camera
I had actually considered the Nikon D7100 but thought the weight wasn't something I wanted to be hiking with
I bought it very cheap from AMAZON
The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.
something I don't often do but other might but it has some great in camera EDITING
At under $300 currently, it delivers great value
You can adjust the exposure or just switch it to the exact type of setting you're in, like at a sporting event, or taking a picture of a pet, it's really easy and it takes great pictures
works great
I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
The best compact zoom camera
Right on target
But I had to upload the directions for all the features
I love the one button on and off for the video
The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
Granted, i am currently deployed in Afghanistan where dust is always a problem
Truly happy with my camera
best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
Took a shot of a full moon, blew it up a little on my software program and the craters on the moon showed up fantastically
i bought this last week through amazon .
, 2)the camera is more bulky than I would have liked
It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
The only thing that really stands out about this camera is its size and price point - both of which aren't pros
Indeed it was, I brought FZ70 with expedited shipping, as I was heading out to SF to see my son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren and I wanted to be able to test it out during the trip
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
There are so many features that I will have to study the manual for a while to know how to use them all
Also, use of monitor increases rate of battery pack depletion
I was forever hitting the playback button with my thumb, because that is the natural way to grip this camera
Ive been using an Olympus for the past 3yrs and love it
The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
I chose it because it is a 20 mp digital
We highly recommend it
Better if optical image stabilization at higher zoom levels was improved
While the size made it super portable, I needed something with more zoom capability and a better lens for low light conditions
Trying to fill a novelty niche, but falls horribly short
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
JUST CAME BACK FROM TRIP
Love it
I loved the 12x zoom and image stabilization for taking the corners of buildings like the Forbidden Palace
trips .
Even higher ISO were less noisy than some other camera's in the same price range
Amazing camera
Be aware that you have to pay the return postage and a hefty restocking fee
I was looking for an easy/solid point and shoot, and the L830 came through
It isnt that loud
However, when you have one reasonably close, you may get a real keeper
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
It is perfect for what I need
The camera itself is light and feels solid
I have no doubt that I could get a good shot with a tripod, but it's usually not possible to bring a tripod and claim the aisle at these kind of events
The camera seems pretty well built, this is our first nikon, we have always had milnota or kodak in the past
Thank you, Missby
Went to Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square PA and followed my normal practice of taking an enormous number of pictures in the hope of getting a few decent shots
I liked it because I was able to make more than one copy, edit it as well as change the setting
Your outdoor vacation shots will simply be amazing
I also went to a horse show
However, I do have a few things to complain about...
Pictures are very low quality
As with any small camera, holding it without interfering with flash etc
I just don't put my finger there - there's no particular reason to do so
Excellent camera
Zoom works great, and pics are clear and vivid
I wanna go shoot something
All other functions mostly very good for price range
Really want to like Nikon but not sure I can buy from them again
This Panasonic camera takes excellent pictures
I know Nikon has a reputation for doing better in low light; I found that wasn't the case unless I used the night setting or museum (too slow for children)
I took one to China with me in 2010 for a short Thanksgiving trip
I love this camera
And when u record video in low light, it makes a movie shutter sound, which can lead to it breaking bcuz I hit it  repeatedly thinking something was jammed
It's a great, thought out, fun product
Picture quality is great in good light
I'm struggling with the lever that zooms the lens
My only disappointment is that it takes more time to focus when using the zoom than I would have thought
Works Great
This is great
I am getting some very nice shots at about half the zoom length, though
For the last few years, I've relied on my Pansonic Lumix F27
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
Nikon Coolpix L830 Diugital Camera
This is a very high quality camera
The good news is that sx700 appears to be what the 280 was supposed to be and more, with better quality and no evidence of the same video/auto shut off problems that plagued the 280
So much so, I generally use my point and shoot far more than my SLR (unless taking pictures of birds)
takes great pics close up and far away
I love the movie feature too
In the end, I only kept the camera for the weekend and decided that this particular camera just isn't for me
It can take pictures even in the darkest place
Easy to use
It's really easy to use, which is a good thing
But I think photographers of all ages and experience levels will enjoy shooting with this camera
We have had it only a few weeks and love it
The images are a little better, the camera is smaller, cheaper and a 20x zoom is still more than most people will ever need
The Nikon Coolpix L830 is no where near as noisey as my Pentax K5 or K30 even if they take batter pictures
I have never shot so many blurry pictures in a 1 week span before
but canon never fails to amaze .
A couple of times I was able to restart it and it would work but now it has died a second time
and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
Some notes- get the class10 memory card
I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple point and shoot
Solid camera
The Nikon COOLPIX L830 was my choice
Great Camera
I also use the memory card to print out photos taken with my Cannon
I did not intend to use the digital zoom but did so by accident and was amazed at the quality when compared to the optical at 60x
Exactly what I wanted
The video is also great just be sure to get a class 6 SDHC card or better and change the options to HQ video and pics(for some reason Nikon defaults to the lower quality)
So back it goes
The panorama assist is great and provides a better scene than the sweep panoramas I tested
Very very nice pics, the &#34;auto modes&#34; work great,
I am just a beginner in the world of photographn but this Nikon Coolpix L830 makes me feel like a photographer with ideas far beyond my novice station
* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
For me, that is a huge bonus
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
The zoom is incredible, crisp clear images
Poor color accuracy, just average sharpness
Great camera
, so I purchased one anyway even with all the bad luck others have had with this camera
Thank you Santa!
Others have mentioned and tested the camera hardware and image quality ad infinitum, so I only want to point out several items that haven't been mentioned in other reviews:1
another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
MACROMacros are very impressive with the FZ70
* main dial is not backlit .
After using a Coolpix L110 for work I liked the ergonomics so I purchased the L830 for my personal use
i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
- takes pretty crappy pictures in bright sunlight
I Expected a Lot
The features of this camera are outstanding from the fantastic picture quality to the extraordinary 60x zoom lens to the HD video
The only complaint I have with this camera is the video
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
I found both just fine
I never use a flash, so the pop-up flash isn't really a bother
for more $$$ of course
Killer Camera with Amazing Battery Life
So much in such a small package
Great Point and Shoot
I bought this camera at the end of August.
My wife just purchased this camera for her upcoming trip abroad,so I can't give it any more than three stars at this point as I have'nt had the chance to fully check it out,but my initial impression is that I'm very impressed with the quality
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
before they are sold out !
Easy to use
Picture quality is bad, shutter cant stop action, file sizes are miniscule, the in camera effects look like they're from 2004
Download it fast to your computer
Basically, I downgraded to a point and shoot with a super zoom 3 years ago
This camera is a great place to start learning and working, and it is also good for people who already understand these settings
Good point and shoot
Why did I wait so long?  detail[-1],color rendition[-1][cc]
Wife loves it
and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.
i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
There is a lot of value in the features
I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now and have shot about 1500 photos with it
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
So why 4 stars? Simply because it 's not perfect and there is room for improvement most notably the EVF and LCD
I have never been a fan of point and shoots for my serious photography, always relying on one of Canons
The photos are crystal clear and true to color
The zoom is great
Speaking of the flash,  there is also undocumented, that the flash is indeed a pop-up, however it is a manual pop-up
We ordered this product through Amazon but I think they fulfilled the order via third party
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
It's great for what it is
stop deliberating and select it
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
I guess I got a dud but I am majorly disappointed in Nikon
IT IS however for the photographer looking for an innovative and unique product with multiple capabilities
Donation
I shoot with D3s and D600 Nikons
I also found the controls annoying, but would have lived with it if it took good pics
Awesome
Not a professional photographer and wanted something easy to use and this fit the bill
This camera also had problems with the autofocus when  used on a very cold day (about 10 degrees F)
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
Takes great pictures
thanks for nothing , amazon !
It didn't hurt anything, and left the protective film on the screen,quite invisible
I love the camera, but it is much different that my other Lumix FZ cameras, and I really really needed an owners manual to take to Yellowstone with me the day after I got it
I would be reluctant to buy a camera anyplace else
I cherish all shots in all locations at all times, and the camera's inability to take even relatively-clear pictures has made the camera useless to me
(Now 1 star- see update)First, there is no remote shutter release system available for this camera
You can use built in differnt scenery mode or let camera decide it for you
I mainly bought the camera for its zoom and it hasn't failed me yet
S graduation, just enough time to learn the basics
First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
The only fuzzy images I have gotten were from testing the continuous shooting mode, and once I learned how to use the mode correctly I got great images with it
for this price that was awesome
you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
I read some negative reviews about the service dept
Bottom line, the pictures out of this camera are very good
I enjoy using this camera
(Darn
It is such an upgrade from my previous camera
big mistake .
I got a picture of a bald eagle, sitting on a telephone pole, on the other side of the Yellow River, must have been 60-70 yards away
It looks really cool- but the printed paper is too smal and the pictures are very blurry especailly when using the flash light
If you're looking for a mid priced p&s; with great image quality then I would recommend this camera
I didn't realize it came with it's own battery and a charger for it
The lens simply can't get enough light at F6
What a difference from the typical point and shoot models
If you are a photographic perfectionist, a so-called "pixel peeper", don't get this camera
if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
In its small size it packs a sufficiently powerful zoom, excellent resolution and high reslution video
Tonight was the best of all - took a picture of the moon - you can see craters CLEARLY in the photo
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
My first camera in this line was the FZ 28
Bulkier and heavier than expected but it takes very good pictures and people comment on the clarity of it's long reach
Nice camera, very simply to use
i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
I gave it 5 stars in reference to the price
Images were frequently washed out and had a soft appearance
This is the best entry level APS-C camera you can buy at this price
good points :
The camera is big, almost the size of DSLR
I would recommend this to anyone
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
Still photos at high resolution you can even see stitching in knit sweater
I decided to go with the Nikon as we already own a D60 and love it
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
I like my camera
What a surprise
my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
Great camera, upgraded from my Nikon Coolpix S8100 when it crapped out
Definitley puts my buddies cameras to shame, and they all paid in the same price range
for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
If it washes out, Move Back,and Zoom In a little to Compensate
I just can't live with that big/heavy a camera
12 mp pictures will not fill up alot of space compared to 1080 video, so if you don't shoot video, the 4 GB card that came with it should be sufficient
The change to a new box of film did not resolve the issue
You won't see a better deal for a mirrorless system with stellar image quality
It's light but it's solid with a nice rest for my thumb
yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
)or far away
A TRUE SONY MIRACLE BOTH IN FEATURES AND PRICING
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
Top notch
A great value, I have had 3 other point and shot cameras( 2 Fuji,1 cannon) this one is the best
Build Quality:Overall, the product quality is very good for this price range
it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
-Durable enough for me
Another huge disappointment is there is no HDMI port
so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
If the lighting outdoors leaves something to be desired, some of the quick post-processing effects can be implemented to immediately color-up, sharpen, brighten, etc to produce beautiful images with little effort
Finally, the software Nikon supplies is lousy
They are working fine, but Duracells seem to be more predictable
The camera was just what I was looking for
I like the weight and feel of my camera
- The 20MP sensor from A58 demonstrates higher noise than comparable sensors(perhaps because of higher pixel density on APS C size)
4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
A couple of years ago I bought a small point-and-shoot (S230) which worked very well when outdoors in good light and was very, very portable, fitting easily into any pocket I had
Excellent
Used the Camera for holiday photos and all were great, and almost never used the flash because it wasn't necessary
It is also easier for me to hold my camera steady when using the viewfinder
Chunky enough to fit in your hands, not small enough and fragile to slip between small cracks and break
I know nothing about any of the other settings
anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
The automatic mode does it all
So far so good
I have owned this camera for about 3 months now and so far it is the best point & shoot camera I have owned and I have owned several
crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
I expected not much but the digital files are of acceptable quality
So, I researched several cameras and this had the price that I needed on my budget but also have nearly as much total zoom as those competing cameras had at twice the price
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
Love this
I wanted a camera that took awesome pictures and this new Nikon Coolpix L830 does that with ease
in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
We have ordered 3 of these camera's
The very wide angle end of the focal range is great for indoor social shots
The zoom works well for static objects but not so well (in my hands) with fast moving objects
Upgrade From Canon SX280; Very Effective Image Stabilization
Inside the house the differences could be seen especially in lower light
I just took approximately 550 pictures of a variety of different subjects: owls, sandhill cranes, ducks, blue heron, butterflies and some superior sunset shots and my ability to reframe shots, focus and change angles almost instantaneously allowed me to take numerous shots that I might have missed with another camera having a slower focus capabilities
Caveats / Downsides: (These are all relatively minor complaints, not deal-breakers, although they're all things that are annoyances that I notice on a regular basis
- Even though its larger and heavier than its predecessors, its still much lighter than an equivalent DSLR
Love this camera
This is NOT your father's/grandfather's camera/camera company
I was not able to get the pictures uploaded to my computer the process was very difficult
Images are a tad soft, but Auto+ does a great job producing solid images
I thought not having the great very wide angle lens and the sweep panorama was ending my photography career
I'll keep this short and to the point
In Arizona, I took lots of photos at an outdoor Chihuly exhibit in the Arizona Botanical Garden, both in the afternoon and early evening light
However, with the SX700 there is no choice, you must use the screen
As of this writing I have only had the camera for about three weeks
I will go on vacation in July andwill do my &#34;homework&#34; before - I promise
Videos are NICE
proven canon built quality and lens .
Did I mention the lens? Killer resolution on both wide and telephoto modes
Great pics
I believe out of about 200 shots I may have had two that were not usable due to camera shake
A better battery door solution is definitely needed for this camera period, I'd take off half a star on my rating if I could
I was looking to replace my old Canon Powershot that's an ultracompact
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
PROS:1) The Polaroid Z2300 has the throwback design that ultimately made it more portable than the Fuji Instax cameras
It is, of course, not covered by warranty -- after 4 months
This is really too bad, but their reputation is shot
I anticipated the arrival of this product for about a week and I was very excited when it was delivered but was immediately disappointed upon using it for the first time
Otherwise, it's a great camera
Easy to use, great pictures
I'm happy and I'd get it again
If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.
I was pleasantly surprised by this camera's performance
The size is tiny, which I love.
So far we have been blown away by the results, fit and finish, but the pictures we processed and blew up were outstanding
I highly recommending getting at least one on the Vivitars as a spare if you're planning to be away from your charger with this camera for any length of time
after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
I am really pround of my choice, this is more that I expected, but the camera is large and a little heavy comparing with the others, but I think is because the zoom
You will find a lot of my S8100 pictures at [
I love the overtly quick zoom capabilities it has, never having to struggle with a locked in zoom that sometimes results in missing a very special shot
I like the fact that I can just plug the camera into the charger instead of removing the battery all the time
the only annoyance is if you happen to turn the camera with the lens cap on, it displays a message and won't go away, even after removing the cap
Uses a rechargeable battery with a tiny life :(
Perfect
The only thing that truly disappoints me is that it does not automatically shut its self off
The zoom is wonderful and for the landscape pictures I take, it is great
Great camera
Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
Very light and slim which makes it easy to carry
The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
and so far , i 've been very pleased .
It was my first time to shoot manual at a concert
most of the time when you look at what you are going to photo thepicture is red
It has some of the excellent Sony features I've always liked such as panorama mode, handheld shake mode (shoots several photos to remove shake, nice for non-moving subjects in low light) and excellent video capability, and the image quality certainly will far outstrip many similarly priced cameras as well
there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
For price, image quality, flexibility and ease of operation they can't be beat
And the other thing I found a bit disappointing was the viewfinder
Bought the AGFA Photo Heavy Duty Rubber lens hood in 55mm and that is a bit problematic
without a Leica lens, I'm sorry
you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
I appreciate it even more after I download the photos to my computer and as I review them, I notice more details that the human naked eyes couldn't even see when taking the photos
Because the t5 is just a beefed up t3 I can use the same batteries, SD card and battery grip I had for my t3
just not for me
Being disabled I can not drive, trust me I tried driving and lets say everyone in Maryland breathed a sigh of relief when I renewed my MTA Maryland Disability Transportation Card
Too big for alternate camera
We wanted the longer zoom, but were disappointed in the results
I doesn't look like the plan to make a remote shutter release for this model
I liked that the mode dial appeared on the LCD when you changed settings
This is an incredible price point camera that delivers, and four of us going to Germany already switched because of the weight situation
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
It didn't miss a beat or even get a scratch
It is the first camera I have used that allows me to get non-blurry pictures of my grandchildren who are constantly moving
i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
I highly recommend this product for the price
I just got back from a trip to DC where I used my iPhone as a backup sometimes, and I got much better quality from the iPhone
It records great videos with stereo sound
Basically I set it to auto everything and I'm just loving the images I'm getting
and am optimistic that I won't be one that has to go that route
we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
Same for high over head pics
It's fun just to take to a party to record for memories and to actually print out the picture in front on your friends/ family will blow their mind
I like a mix of AUTO and manual - this one has it, and manual is extremely easy to call up and use, unlike that mode for the other two brands
Colors were all off
My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
Beautiful, compact and feature loaded camera
i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
VERY smal.
the camera is fairly intuitive and can be used without reading anything, but I HIGHLY suggest you read up on it and get the most out of this camera
Good image quality.
I shot over 850 images meticulously testing settings and options in numerous situations and ended up with three pictures I thought were really good
Obviously, if you're a serious photographer, this is not the camera for you, but for me, it's great
cool nikon
Now for the not so good part
Bought this for a conference event
Great Camera
i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
For the price, could have included an SD card and instruction manual
Nikon Coolpix S8100 is totally cool
Love the simplicity, the 34x zoom, the easy picture modes and manual setttings, the video, the sound
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
I love this camera
( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
So far every feature on the camera seems to work just fine
I was in love but now I am not
I'm not a photographic expert so I don't know what to call it when the camera enhances photos but it does a great job
It's a brilliant camera, and if you see one available but it
Very easy to operate for someone with dexterity issues or large hands
Excellent camera for the price point
This is an all around great addition to the amateur photographer or as a basic family camera
Holiday Gift
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
Awesome lay out of buttons: record for video is a hard button that can be used in any mode
In my opinion, this product is not worth any price
After that the images are good enough, but has higher noise than the Fuji
It is so easy to use, my wife doesn't have to even think about what to do
It has a built in macro lens for shooting small objects/flowers/insects
You can find those images at the Users Gallery above
Well satisfied
All in all it does allow low light photos
The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
Sharp results against complex landscapes
I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
Very easy to use and the preview screen is large
Very happy with it
I loved the size, and feel of this Nikon
It makes you look like a PRO Videographer
I'm still discovering its numerous features
I have experienced with several DSLRs from Canon, Nikon and Pentax
Love this camera
It's lighter and smaller, the zoom lens covers about as much territory as you can use without a tripod, and the image quality is significantly better
great idea but thats it
i use it everyday and the pictures are amazing
The Samsung NX2000 that has bigger sensor, was much more accurate, and the pictures, were much better, no blurry photos
You get down to 20mm, btw, which is wide enough to capture a large family reunion photo, and in the next shot you can fill the frame with one persons eye
LOVE IT
Camera startup is reasonably speedy, something less than 3 seconds from start/focus/take picture in low light ( faster outside)
the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
and at this price who can resist?
Five Stars
The manual is excellent.
The big attraction for me with the FZ70 was the extra zoom but if I can get the same IQ cropping my FZ150 shots that cancels out the main advantage of the FZ70 for me
Things like the drumset will be in focus but anything moving like the drummer will be blurred
Photos are also beautiful
Im very happy with this purchase
6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
I believe I will keep it for outdoor shots but for flash it is in the way of the distance finder which apparently determines the amount of flash
i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
My son printed out a little 2 by 3 picture that he took of he and his brother in law and it is perfect for my wallet
I haven't used it for video, but he does and loves it
I've had much better luck using a monopod or even better, a solid tripod (as one reviewer suggested) to get those very sharp long range shots
you're not going to find a better camera for this price
The camera has significant focusing issues while shooting video especially if you go from a bright area to a shaded area of vice versa
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
My Nikon S8100 failed on the second day of use after about 20 shots with a fatal lens error
it has many great features and very few bad ones .
i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
most of these " annoyances " , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
there is usb , though .
I find it easy to operate
Even ISO 3200 images look good enough for snapshots or other casual shooting
Perhaps I need some time to study it and experiment, but I am disappointed with the picture quality
Wanted to do a replacement, but this seller does not offer this exchange
2 at the widest end)  and shooting without any flash
comfortable size and style
I was very happy with this purchase at first
You will be getting good use from them with this camera
The 10mp camera is great but don't expect much in low lighting
Four short months this camera was released and as it's the only light weight camera with a 20mm wide angle I just had to try it
I've only had this camera for a few days and am having a blast
This camera is awesome and deserves a 5+ star rating
And now the SX700 with a 30 zoom
Friends and family have been amazed at the quality of the photos taken with this camera
if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
I love taking photos
Other than being an excellent value, the FZ70 gives you the ultimate in convenience
Nikon s8100
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
I'm in love
Focus is fast and accurate
point and shoot camera
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
Overall I think ii is a fine camera
You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
One single lens covers 20mm-1200mm equivalent and  Full 1080/60iHD Panasonic Video recording with auto focus
If you enjoy "tweaking" settings this camera allows plenty of room to experiment
still zippo
Photos taken in daylight or bright indoor lighting display vibrant color and are very sharp
I used this camera on my vacation to Costa Rica
Features = zero and the biggest issue I have with it is that it is incredibly latent
Nikon S8100
The bad:Viewfinder is smallLCD is not that sharp and does not swivel (I use it to compose not review my pics, so does not affect me
I found the menu to be clunky, and many basic features like shutter and aperture settings, manual focus (or at least a user-selected Macro mode) were either lacking entirely or buried in some menu that I couldn't find when I needed it
Its very bulky, which i guess isnt to bad because it does print pictures instantly
I understand you can buy a separate battery-charger
I can honestly say i am very satisfied with this purchase
Most other reviews claim that it has a super fast, user friendly way to import your pictures to your hard drive
The photos were blurry no matter how hard we tried to hold it still
I could not find the special effects for the colors such as grey etc
Again this is the best SLR-like value in the history of digital cameras bar none since you can pick this up between 248-279 dollars pretty commonly right now
high quality camera
Now you can change change the mode dial into any mode
great resolution, battery life is fantastic, love that you can turn the camera on before removing the lens cap without grinding the motor like on the Nikon P 500
I only have one minor complaint
I am beyond pleased and will experiment with settings other than AI
I tried out the comparable Canon and Lumix before deciding on this one
Works well for our purposes, but the memory and battery life is low and the pictures come out off color from what is shown on the screen
Like it better than the comparable Cool Pix
People keep knocking this camera for it's lower res LCD and viewfinder and other minor issues
Low light still pictures with no zoom are your best bet for a good shot
I have used it with people in a patio setting with high contrast problems abounding and it does a spectacular job
Both free
The zoom is fabulous, and most of the time, I didn't have problems with blurry zoomed photos
The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
I have no idea why Panasonic would advertise such a high powered zoom that performs so poorly
Problem with edges
like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
Poor camera choice, stick to cannon, kodak, or sony
I bought this for work because I need to occasionally take pictures or video of things to upload to social media sites
It's perfect for this use
Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price.
This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
Also, it uses a high powered light to gauge the target apparently, so it's not stealthy
The aperture quickly drops as you zoom in on objects
Great camera that takes great pictures
It is also really quick (start up and shutter speed)
I tried the IA and IA+ with this camera and took many pictures in different conditions
i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
I thought the unit was a little cheaply made but hope it works well after I get the hang of operating it properly
Excellent Bridge Camera for Amateurs and "Semi-Pros"
Best Compact Cameras for zoom
although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
As far as build quality goes, this camera is very light and doesn't feel like there's much to it
as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
Great buy
It might survive a knock or two, though
We were not disappointed at all
As with my other Lumix cameras, I never use a tripod, and the stability feature of this camera is as good as the previous models
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
i give it 10 stars !
poor bulid quality
after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
This is the  best value EVER in a digital SLR-like removable lens camera
This camera is amazing
Does well in good light situations
and now I'm going to return it
for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
It feels good and solid
A really nice feature you don't take into consideration until you're in that predicament
pogo polaroid instant photos for art journaling/scrapbooking/travel journaling
Easy to operate
good enough
The pictures are crisp
Great Shots for less Money
it was quite irritating
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
If you touch the lens when it zooms in or out, it reports &#34;lens error
This Lumix has most of the features of the Canon as well as a few extra, a larger optical zoom (60x as opposed to 50x on the Canon) and is priced about $35 less than the Canon
It takes excellent point & shoot pictures just using all the defaults (it seems to be smarter than I am)
the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
Underneath its skin, there is no mirror nor prism at all
this should give you an idea of the capabilities of the camera
This is my third one, and it's a beauty
The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
Upon first attempt to import my photos, it failed to install the drivers crucial to allowing ease of access to the camera's files
its continuous shooting mode
To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
We also took some shots outside after dark and this camera really excels at night
i just bought the camera a few days ago .
The zoom  brings the picture right to you
We have always had trouble getting good shots of the kids during school programs due to poor lighting, I dont think that will be the problem anymore after using this camera at night
However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder.
VIDEOWow again
Digital
my son loves it
The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
I took all four cameras, put them on a tripod and shot photos using the standard 18-55mm kit lens that came bundled with the camera
The built in flash appears to be movable to simulate a 'bounce flash'
Great instant fun
My six year old point and shoot camera gives better quality photos and a better screen than this camera
I plan on taking it on vacation so I will run it through the gauntlet then
I wish I had researched a bit more to get the latest, but I had to have a replacement camera quickly
Just ordered, and received it in 1 day
I did a lot of research on cameras before purchasing this one
At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
For a new $350 camera I expected better
Compared to a mirrorless camera like the Nex 3 or 5, this camera is superior in nearly every way except the size
I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend on our anniversary
The camera is easy to use and has loads of features
THis camera is significantly more weight in the hand
&#8230;
ugly to boot
They are crisp and clear, and the color is beautiful
i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
I like to buy a less expensive camera in case I drop it in a lake or off a bridge by accident, and this seems fine for the price
We have 2 small children and the shutter speed had been an issue on the older camera, so we were hoping this would be an upgrade- unfortunately the speed was not much faster
However, a little trial and error suffices as it is not all that complicated
Bottom line - i think the professional reviewers were paid by another company to push their camera, and am very glad i tested all of the contenders before purchasing
It comes with everything you need to start except a case and SD card
can use hot shoe6
Both issues are easy to deal with once you know they exist
So far the indoor shots I took along with some outdoor ones are crisp, clear, and the 60 zoom is about as far as you can go without losing photo quality
i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
you have to push a button to switch between the two
Still, everything seems to fit together tightly and the housing is sturdy
Love both cameras
It seems the past 3-4 years I have always purchased whatever point-and-shoot camera is on sale on Black Friday and I am always displeased with it within several months of usage and then buy another one the next year
I read that it is recommended to drop exposure by 1/3
)(1) ISO speed, which I change VERY frequently, requires going into the menu to change
Five Stars
It has great value
I was able to get them back by downloading a program on my computer and reading the card separately from my camera, but my god that sucked
This camera takes good photos, but I am unable to download them into my ASUS tablet like I could with a previous Canon and other friend's cameras
I am satisfied
I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
I decided to go with Nikon as a last resort of ever finding a decent camera at a decent price which someone of decent intelligence could operate
The NEX has a lot of very cool high-tech amenities such as WiFi live viewfinder for smartphones and tablets, a gorgeous, ultra sharp high resolution touch screen, two control wheels and customizable buttons, and also has some far better photographic features like phase detection autofocus, 10fps shooting speed, 1080 60p video
I was looking to buy a mid price all purpose zoom camera
There are other, cheaper Polaroid cameras that print better pictures on actual film and are much more sturdy
Nice Camera, full HD pics and Video, not as heavy as las lumix versions
It does operate in low light, produces pictures with great fidelity
It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
You have all the semi-auto modes of DSLR Plus full manual and full auto
You can also select which picture you would like to print which is great
I thought the pictures would turn out clearer
It also means you can't immediately play back footage from the camera on a TV until you edit it and put it on a disk or an SD card if your TV has a slot
Cheap, light, good sensor, but that's about it
Excellent Product strongly suggested
When the camera detects a flash is needed, it automatically pops up
Five Stars
pocket chainsaw
the screen cracked and couldnt turn it on
Lots of bells and whistles, but lacking in photo quality
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
Enough said
I've tried this and the results are great
- Resolution up to 16
Very Amateur Photographer
Besides, 720p video is plenty of resolution for me
Macro and portrait functions work well too
i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
Good Camera for the price
Beautiful image stabilization, especially at 30x without tripod or mono
This is a great camera
Being in the military and deployed, this bothers me as I have to continually make a conscious effort to keep the screen from being damaged
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
The flash quality is good too
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
I had earlier purchased a Panasonic 18X zoom and was favorably impressed with its optics and functionality
The face recognition system works really well, how did they get it to do that?5
There are still some features I have to use
THe clarity of it is wonderful and it is extremely easy  to use
The main operating features are very intuitive
This is a very nice camera
I have all kinda of cameras and lenses but when it comes down to it I don't want to carry them around
A Great Camera
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
I hope that Sony didn't do that to this camera too
WOW
Neat little camera
1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical image
This camera is huge
Good grab and go camera
Lens quality:I am satisfied with the image quality
I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
Despite the fact I can't just slip it into my pocket the FZ70 is very light
I bought this camera to donate for a raffle to raise money for life
I was considering getting the Nikon 520 due to it's slightly higher resolution but got this instead because of the much longer focal length zoom
The color on the printed 2X3 is inconsistent, sometimes very orangish
5 stars
I think that for the price and the quality of the pictures, this camera is one I would certainly recommend
I wouldn't want anything to happen to this camera
After painstakingly researching media and reviews for all of the latest models in this category, I couldn't pass up the deal on this Lumix FZ70
This is a camera for the niche market
My son is using it to launch his youtube career -- he really needs to focus on college
Just get familiar with the menu and settings
Really bought this model because I wanted the 10x zoom feature
I will update the review after a few weeks and my comfort level grows with the camera but for now I am in love
the best in semiprofesional cameras
I have purchased two of these one for each of us as we like them that well
Also, the fact that the flash was right under where you would put your fingers, made it longer to take pictures because sometimes the flash would pop out under the fingers and you would have to do a double take
In every mode except Manual the settings are easy to find and use
if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
If you want a fun camera that helps you shares memories in a unique way, I recommend this camera
It's a little jewel.
I LIKE:- Sony E-mount compatibility- Built-in pop-up flash- Built-in stereo microphones- Accessory hot shoe with smart connector (supports optional stereo microphone)- Low light performance- Video quality- Excellent picture quality overall- Battery life- in-camera charging via USB cable- Simple, intuitive user interface- Built-in electronic viewfinder (great for shooting in bright sunlight)- Light weight, good balance, comfortable to hold- Available inexpensive adapters for just about any type of mount, allowing you to use old SLR lenses you can find at garage sales (in full manual mode, of course, don't expect autofocus
no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
Any input on this issue is greatly appreciated
First off, let me say that I am not a pro, or even a hobbyist photographer
The SX700 is a nice, full-featured but not-too-expensive, 2nd camera for this enthusiast
The camera claims to shoot 20-megapixel photos, and I'd believe it by the file size, however none of the 100+ photos had the crisp look when zoomed in to 100% that I expect for a printable photo any larger than 5&#34; x 7&#34;
I could go on but suffice to say, I was very unhappy
The first, and most obvious, is the difference in digital zoom
olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
It's very easy to use and looks great
the flash ruins most pics
They turn out blurry
Use it in anything but good light and things go downhill with the overly aggressive noise reduction
Also, there are no instructions as to how to format a SD card
The viewing screen is difficult to see in bright sunlight
I started using it straight out of the box without having to read a book of instructions
i love the quality of the pictures .
Slightly bigger and heavier than its predecessor SX280
Great skin color
There are 2 pictures with an Airstream trailer, one at no zoom, the other at 10x zoom
Two of us had these little wonders
By bumping down to 2048x1536 you can dramatically speed this up to 5 sec, and you can get a really quick cycling by using the tiny 640x480 resolution
ISO 400 and 800 work very well: 400 is especially sharp
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
What a great compact camera
I don't think another 12" would have increased the cost that much but it sure would have made it easier to use
I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
In order to store a decent amount of photos on the camera you will need to by a memory card in addition to the camera
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
awesome
The included battery charger is larger!
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
It replaces an old FZ-7 which still works but the new features and the wide angle on the FZ70 made me want it
The only thing I absolutely do not like is the flash
do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
) will do a better job
Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise.
I have several different cards, but I really recommend something fast, like an extreme or extreme pro by san disk
My only wish is that the t5 had come with the sensor cleaning function Canon's earlier models came with
The auto mode works in most cases
With that being said, the quality of pictures taken with the flash down are so that a little color/contrast editing bring the pictures back to top quality (sometimes better than other P&S; cameras with a flash)
I thought I might miss a digital viewfinder but discovered that, with the brightness turned up on the LCD, the viewfinder was quite useable in bright sunlight and the view is stunning in hi resolution
The image quality and price both align to this middle of the spectrum range, and for a 20MP APS-C sensor this is a great value
But even half of my &#34;portrait&#34; pictures were out of focus and blurry
Buy some extra batteries
I have a decent collection of M42 (Screwmount) lenses that I use with it
JPG
another amazing example of the low light quality in videos
That is why the instructions tell you to PUT THE STRAP ON YOUR CAMERA
I took photos of a house on the side of a hill that is located about 500 yards away and then enlarged the resulting JPEG files on my computer using a 23&#34; HP LCD screen
I took a series of identical shots with both cameras and found the the Lumix had vastly better low-light images, with more detail coming through
One thing that DSLRs do great is bokeh (keep one part of image in focus, while rest is unfocused)
Also the exposure looks fine on the screen but when seen on viewer/computer, it's a bit too dark
The battery life is good too
-Takes amazing panoramas
The increased functionality of having manual controls makes it more flexible than an automatic camera
I keep having to put in new batteries every time I turn around to use it
And has more than enough settings to capture the image in many differnt lights and you can edit on the camera
I love this camera!
Still learning
This camera performs really well in multiple conditions
For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
I can't wait to take it off of "Auto" mode and try some of the other settings
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
I thought I was always going to be a Cannon guy, but found out differently
One thing that strikes me is that why Sony restricts to RAW+JPEG when I want to choose RAW
A steady hand is required at all times or forget it
I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a very solid point and shoot camera
Easy menu and correct weight
So far the battery life is great, I have taken several hundred photos (mostly w/o flash) and taken probably an hours worth of video, the battery is still about 1/4-1/2 full
prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
You just need to learn about the camera and what the different scenes and adjustments do
However I do not recommend this
I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
Has a separate button for movies; hence you can take a movie, then a photo, then a movie, etc
Wonderful camera
They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
The price was very good
Love the Nikon Coolpix l830
No can do with this camera
The new SX700 also introduces an interesting feature - Zoom Framing Assist, which should help with composing shots of far distant subjects
Mine is still fine and I've taken thousands of photos and some video
Speckeled noise is much more visible in lower light areas
I truly recommend this camera, but keep in mind you are not buying a $2000 camera
I have also ordered and started using the DMW-LT55 lens with the adapter, you need an adaptor to use the long range lens and I cant even express how great my photos are
I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
Canon has a much better processor in it
It compliments my Nikon D5000 nicely
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3
The onboard menu is easy to understand
I can zoom in all the way and still capture a clear crisp shot of it
The FZ200 has a Leica lens
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
I love this Polaroid it was everything I wanted
Still, I think a higher-resolution/DPI screen would be a nice change to this camera
I think this is a good thing for people who is learning photography
It feels great in my XL hands
At amazon
Thank you
I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
It looks awesome on the viewer but after the button is pushed the picture is fuzzy somewhat
It then combines the two shots giving a true to life image of the the person and background
Great camera for on the go people
The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
Compact, great features, and takes very sharp, excellent photos
This zoom should be illegal
very excited
In playback, you can choose to rotate the photos manually
I could forgive the lack of control if the image quality was spectacular, but it is far from it
The zoom is fantastic
The bulky size to accommodate the 4 AA batteries and lack of a viewfinder (a common complaint for most LCD cameras) cost this other great camera one star
If they do fix it, I'll give it to my kids and let them play with it
I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
Never abused.
the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
It is easy to use, easy to hold and the moveable viewfinder is great
Picturetastic
excellent pictures and video
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
the pictures are asome, the zoom is the best, and have take some full moon pictures that you can see tha craters
And the lens cover does not come with a safety cord
I will be using it today at a soccer meet with my Granddaughter playing and can't wait to see how it performs
Mine came with all these plug adapters for different countries, which may be useful for those that travel, but I just stored them in the junk drawer
The photos are just breathtaking and better than anything I've ever seen or was able to accomplish with any other camera
I have taken very good care of this camera
All of this in one camera
this is not a handbag camera .
The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
I have had Nikon, Canon, Fuji
Good for a novice photographer
Indoor shooting is okay in most lighting conditions, though it struggles in low light
Others have written plenty about the pros and cons
You can pick up external 3rd party dual battery chargers as well for around 20 dollars on EBAY and possibly AMAZON since AMAZON has now caught on big time to making lots of camera accessories that you used to find only on EBAY
I bought it as a gift and I almost swapped it with my Olympus when I saw the great pictures that it produced
There is a site online that tells how to jump ahead in the numbering schema but that is just putting off the problem
Though it is still better (yes even the audio) than the Flip (any generation) or Kodak Zi8 & Zi10 for video
It's just not worth it
sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
It shoots video better than most cameras under 1000 dollars, especially if you go through the menu and turn off some of the automatic features
Then she turned their FZ70 on and she held it up to her ear and said "oh my golly there is a continuous noise"
20MP allows me to crop images without losing detailNoise is very well controlledGrip is very good
I read that you had to manually do the flash prior to purchasing, but I figured I would be okay with it
Most functions have to be accessed via a menuing system that seems a bit tedious to me
The zoom is spectacular
after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
I FOUND IT
Works nice and takes video also
It doesn't explain the different modes at
Nice pics, weak lens cover
I bought my camera based on recommendations from my other friends who own it.
The form fit of the SX700 is a little bit bigger but offers some advance features that make the size increase very worthwhile
you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
As such, the A3000 does not have a pentaprism/mirror of a traditional DSLR
and then stick it where you want
get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
At the upper end of the zoom range, the focus is a little soft
Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70
It takes great pictures in low light areas and has a stabilization mobilizer
I was able to pick this camera up with the extra Sony E 55-210mm F4
you will hear the little stabilization motors running when it is zoomed out
It is a little bit challenging to take a photo when focusing on something far away, but it is a matte of getting developing a technique
This is my third camera,all different brands,but this is great in low light and great if you have a shakie hand
quality great an every light weight
very cheaply made .
Why Nikon didn't include a stand a lone charger with this camera is beyond me
you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
ok a Christmas present for my wife (wink) and its awesome so far
turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date.
First Rule taking photos With A Camera, Have One
These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
This one of the greatest camera that I have seen for the money
April 30, 2014Although I have a fair amount of experience with 35mm SLR photography, this is my first "non-pocket" digital camera
My wife constantly complains about missing shots because she forgot to switch the camera back to shooting mode
Got the dreaded "Lens Error" message and it would not work
In the end I decided to go with the Nikon and I was not disappointed
If you like using your phone to take instagrams your going love this camera
is the flash placement
Cameras battery only lasted for a few minutes untill you had to recharge
Lot of research
I was not in need of a new point and shoot, but it was on a great deal and I had a gift card to burn up so I took a shot
Don't hesitate to get this camera
absolutely breathtaking .
In short, if your looking to get into the world of manual focus lenses cheaply, this is the camera for you
The macro is fantastic in camera and movie mode and I would say that plus the zoom are the camera's best features
I was extremely excited and looking forward to this feature only to find out it was completely useless
I suspect I was swayed by the positive reviews I read
It takes a little getting used to but highly recommend it
This may be a hassle for some people but since I choose what pictures to print and save, not so much of a dealbreaker, just wanted to point it out to others
Great pictures and easy to use
I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
I saw my 10-year old bury his head in the manual for a moment or two & proceed to snap off a few zoomed frames overlooking the peninsula
I got a lens error and the lens would not retract
Takes awesome pictures
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
Worth it for the in-camera automatic HDR processing
It has been all that I read about and I am very satisfied with my selection
NIKON COOLPIX L830 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
Finally a Canon with a setting for Snow White Balance.
Color is great
It is actually very light and came with a nice leather case
And I like not having my camera precariously perched on a hotel window sill whilst charging
I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me.
After reading all of the reviews, I bought the camera and it performs as advertised
my daughter loves it, great for that quick spontaneous picture
you do have to purchase an extra sd card and more paper refills, but it was worth it
The size of the camera is perfect.
be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
For a $200 range camera, try to avoid expecting too much from zoom without a tri-pod but even still know that the picture is not going to be perfectly clear zoomed all the way to 34x
Too many of those advertised on amazon
Love the camera
Side dug out my window mount because you must have a steady mount if you're going to take pictures at high magnification
But you can get great shots almost immediately out of the box
I bought this camera last March
any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
You can learn how to work with the flash but it takes adjustment and fidgeting and you can't just expect to take good flash photos out of the box
Not much of a learning curve at all for me, because I had a different Coolpix prior to this so it's similar
No stitching photos together, just click and hold the shutter button and turn
Sorry Nikon, going back to canon brand
i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
I miss my Nikon horribly but I do enjoy this little gem for about half the price
Yes, it is bigger than many purely digital cameras but you have to take into consideration that it has the printer inside
What I gained in one area I lost in another between my fz50 and  fz70
(And it is so much lighter than my digital SLR
I like having backlit as a mode dial option
The old POGO film works with this camera and is cheaper than the Z2300 film
I love this camera
After twelve prints, I am not getting true colour
i love it and i would recommend it to many people
For this price point you can't beat this camera
This is a next gen camera so it should do all of that stuff well and it does
Find it expensive for what it is
I was looking forward to using this on vacation but unfortunately was not able to
i called them twice and both times they said it is " about to ship " .
I am not a great or even good photographer, but part of my job involves taking photos and incorporating them into my journals
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
That makes taking pictures much more efficient
The color is always perfect
I like the ease of selecting the shooting mode, switching between the various menus, and the playback mode is similar to my old Canon
Five Stars
AMAZON
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
The photo and video quality is excellent
First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
This is the best point and shoot camera
card reader is included .
In many instances just to make simple exposure tweaks you have to go several levels deep in the menu system
sony great model camera, delivered ok, little pack, good pricepros: allcons: noi recomend this camera to any
This is an awesome camera for the money
now where did i put that manual ?
Consequently, it's very tough to take pictures in the sunlight
I really have been really happy with the wind noise reduction when taking videos and the ability to stay in focus when zooming in video mode
Also have Pentax, Nikon, Kodak cameras (SLRs and P&S;)
Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
Except, it should cost about 100 dollars cheaper
Instead of the 9 FPS as advertised, I could only get 3, then wait, refocus, then 3 more
Nothing works
It didn't take long to learn the features and functions
If i want manual control, it's there
takes good pictures for what i needed it for
This camera shipped really quickly and will be a really cool gift
the big Zoom with image stabilization is a dream come true
Another excellent (and cheaper) alternative is the Samsung WB350 (I have reviewed that camera too on Amazon)
Thanks to the super zoom and the uninitiated's inability to get a steady shot there are plenty of these as "used" which are in fact open box
a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
The continuous shots I took were a little blurry, but I think with some practice, this may improve
A bit large for point in shoot, but likely realistic alternative
6) It labels videos as "images" so that when you want to replay or delete them, it's confusing, and you might accidentally delete a video thinking it's an image
The salesman kept playing with it
I really expected this camera to make better pictures
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
this camera is amaizing , very easy to use and the 60x zoom is wonderfull i need more time for review the many options to use
I will upload some images when I shoot more with it
In my opinion some options, like scenes or light setup, should be acessed with the external bottom, without the obligation to go to Menu
The compromise is that it is a little larger but still fits into the front pocket of my Levis (it will fit in my shirt pocket also, but its weight makes it a little uncomfortable there)
Zoom brings the subject right to you
People are not aware SONY makes the chips and motherboards for the others mentioned and the results in tests we ran with the camera and optics especially in the wides with incredible low light and little or no distortion
And another thing about stealth:10) This is a noisy camera, and there is no option to lower the volume of the beeping or turn it off
I always end up placing my finger on top it
Not really great
It is pretty annoying and I'm thinking that pretty soon the flash is going to fall off the camera or break
Had problems with noise and image quality
I don't feel like dealing with returning the camera and waiting for a replacement, because I just want something I can use now
Excellent camera
I am a full-frame guy myself, but I thought I would give this new mirrorless camera a shot to see how it performed
Which is a result of the CMOS sensor it has which is also why it is good in low light conditions
Sure, it has a few things that could be better (more control over continuous burst speed, slow down the shot speed on the 16 shot mode, better video setting controls, maybe put the flash 1/4 of an inch to over) but if they fixed all that, it would probably sell for 400 bucks
i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
Great camera so far
I was really stressed about which type of camera to buy and was unsure on if this camera would work
We will take it to local camera shop for repairs
Great battery life and easy to use controls
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
It is a little bulkier than most of the compact cameras but the added features make this very compelling
The display on the back of the camera is not as good as I would like, but it is functional and you will be able to tell what you are doing
I won't waste time with too in depth of a review as there are already plenty of them
The mode dial is well thought out; the auto scene select mode is dynamite
Also the image quality was very sub-par
Being sure the image stabilizer is on if very difficult to ascertain
perfect gift
Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
that is one thing I leaved from buying a variety of cameras from various makers
I was willing to give up certain items, in a swap for that awesome zoom capability, but the quality that was lacking in the photos themselves, was just not worth it
I don't want to have to tweak a point-n-shoot
Great camera / value
present
Incredible range from 25mm wide to 750mm telephoto for stills and video
Usually, it is deemed that low price mean low quality but this digital instant print camera proved it wrong
unfortunately we are no longer able to return the product but want to let people know that it is of poor quality
Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
To date, I have been unable to use the Wi-Fi feature to download to Mac computers and into iPhoto
I wanted a fast point-n-shoot camera
I did tons of research and finally settled on this one with the price range I had
That's what I wanted and hoped for
Great Product
I know exactly which camera is mine in the group on the table
Best camera I've ever had
The consumer wins big time on the A3000
I bought an external charger with two batteries off EBAY for $10
It ivery easy to use and does a great job
i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
Very easy to use as well
i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
Poor experience overall
he say the pix are great
The included software removes any red eye easily.
Most disappointed
I ordered this camera for a European trip because I did not want to lug around my large and heavy Canon 40D, and I wanted higher quality photos that can be achieved from a cell phone
Get it and you won't be sorry
It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
-The flash is in a funny spot, but i dont get upset about it
Really need an owners manual
Takes great pictures for the price
The camera works as expected and the video and photos taken are really great
Battery life, not as good as others, but OK
The printing time for the picture isn't long at all usually a few seconds and ta-dah you have a printed picture
Before this purchase, I was a sony fan, but I am a fan no longer
This was the great selling point of their cameras
I'm not a professional photographer, nor do I spend hours on my computer editing photos & video
Tremendous camera with terrific price
I love this Nikon Coolpix L830 because; the more I learn about it the more it becomes an extention of my imagineation
Uses real batteries
The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
The image quality is not good at all if there is any kind of motion in the picture
I have a Nikon D90 for taking exceptional photos and that will be the camera I always go to for professional results
got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
)The MAIN difference between the two is in the screen resolution: 460,000 dots for the T5 vs 1,040,000 dots in the T5i
So based on the previous reviewers who give their pros and cons, thank you so much
and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
The pictures are very sharp and the zoom is good
If you want a flexible, easy, point and shoot
the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
Sony also has implemented HDR and panoramic function with the A3000 and I applaud these features
This is my first Sony I also have a Nikon D5000 but at times you do not need a big camera so the Sony is great
Every time I review the pictures from this great little camera, I am always amazed at how good this inexpensive point and shoot is
However, the AGC does a good job bringing down the levels of loud music without distortion
This has caused me to lose some great shots
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
I have had 3 different cameras since the beginning of the digital camera age, and this one is by far the best
I purchased this camera after my Nikon Coolpix S8200 broke down on me again for the second time
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
The screen would show the error code "this card write protected"
I want it to take good pictures for me
Excellent Purchase/Excellent Seller
Finally purchased FZ70 and quickly verified how great was the power zoom  beyond the optical range at 132X
Takes beautiful pictures
Spend three times the price and maybe it might be better
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
The sound could be a bit better, but it's certainly not bad enough to complain
CONS:1) Picture quality is not always the best, you have to learn what setting works for what scene
Really good for what it is
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
I really can't complain about this camera
I do not like the LCD screen either
Some people may be put off by its light weight and plastic body; it feels solid enough for my needs
I set my Polaroid Z2300 at 8MP and the pictures come out nice, very little gets cropped in the printing process
it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
With peaking assist, I could nail the focus with auto magnification
Tried the "Trouble Shooting" suggestions
it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
The buttons are rather stiff.
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
Raw files from this camera provide a lot of flexibility for post processing
Easy to use
I would recommend it
I'm disappointed there aren't more settings (the point-and-shoot digital camera I bought back in 2006 seems to have more) or it's not intuitively obvious how to use them
The 60x times optical zoom is like having aportable telescope
I love how you can pick which pictures you want, add boarders, edit colors
Photos taken in dim lighting requiring an ISO setting of 800 (or higher) are not very good
The number one reason to get a camera like this is the full manual controls over such things as shutter speed and aperture
There is a bit of a learning curve - truthfully a fairly steep learning curve to master the camera
Don't get me wrong I love my Pro Canon EOS camera but this one is very easy to carry, up to date on technology, links to my phone, it's just a perfect all around point and shoot digital with enough manual options to make this semi pro photographer happy
and the pictures are really very small
This is my third DMC-series Lumix
+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
My wife and I take a lot of wild life photos
And the video quality is amazing.
)  Really great stabilization
Great camera, good price
Easy to use and 60x zoom is awesome
I've been wanting a Polaroid camera for a while & received this one for Christmas
Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
It is sophisticated looking and easy to work
But the pictures are beautiful
The camera takes great night pictures - I have had great luck at concerts and outdoors with the Night Landscape (more so than the Night Portrait which uses flash)
I've resorted to keeping a rubberband around the body to keep it from opening
So far I love it
What the heck - can anyone give me some help here??I left on a trip after only having the camera for a week and hadn't really road tested it
picture clear
very poor quality
So when we got the camera, it had been opened, photos taken on it (digital ones) and you could clearly tell that the quality control  by the third party and amazon is not there
I'm glad to report that Lumix have done a great job
I&#8217;m not sure Sony&#8217;s engineers were any more certain of who ultimately they were targeting either since images cannot be saved in RAW format independently
Great camera no complaints
Don't care how good the pictures are when you use the camera in the sun
Picture quality is unbelievable
it 's a winner .
PROTECT YOUR CAMERA
Who knowsÖ maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
There isn't enough right up or videos about this camera but I literally watched every video by Graham Houghton on YouTube about FZ200 and that helped me to decide purchasing FZ70 as the features and functions are nearly identical in these two cameras
if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
I do notice that when I shoot in flourescent lighting, there sometimes is a yellowish hue when I use the flash and the distance is a little long
Just about anyone should love this
It makes great low-light pictures, something that my old camera wasn't doing
Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
I prefer using the zoom lens on this kind (superzoom/bridge) of camera, because it allows quick AND smooth zooming action using the convenient, powered zoom ring around the shutter release
I'm marginally disappointed with that camera because it's slow and too noisy in low light but at the time of purchase I was pleased with it's zoom (25-500mm)
It is amazing
The shots out of this rival in color and sharpness that of my DSLR (when the dslr is shooting in
hard to go wrong with this machine
For the money this camera cant be beat
I just had this beautiful camera delivered tonight
Quality is a bit poor
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
It's hard to pull out the battery cover, and all the buttons are very stiff
I guess if wifi doesn't matter to you then this is your camera
And the fact that this camera allows you to control these features and so many more manually means you can make great photographs
i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
The Lumix DMC-FZ70 is amazingly versatile and can pretty much take care of all of your photography needs
I took this to a party and everyone wanted a picture
I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.
So simple and we got fantastic pictures in San Diego
" I'm not sure what this error means, but we couldn't use the camera
SUCH a great camera
i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
At first it looks and feels a bit like the first round of digital point and shoot cameras
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
This is the best beginner DSLR and some tips on shooting
I wanted a bridge camera that had a longer zoom than my fz200, didn't break the bank and was small and light enough to actually keep with me
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
I was also perplexed at the menu manipulation and understanding what the camera was telling me it could do
Both the 820 and the 830 came with neck straps so hopefully they'll fare better
it focuses in a snap .
Don't have to do any image editing straight out of the cameraImages are sharpLighting is accurate, and the camera resolves high contrast very well in dummy mode (ie Full Auto)It has a Viewfinder
Takes great pictures -- I just need to learn and practice more
In the stores it was $299, on sale for $249
SMILE
Also,  you can use other PSAM settings if you think the camera will do better than your own eyes using the manual control setting
Until I get the update to solve this, I will be shooting RAW and JPEG
however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
Awesome Camera though
7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
I'll update in 30-45 days if any issues arise, but it is exactly what I felt it should be, and the $$ is fairly set
this seemed like a really good compromise .
The camera is a great size and fits in her purse/pocket
I have used cannon and kodak and I have to say this camera is by far the easiest to use
The telephoto lens gave me incredible, clear pictures and using the built in editing feature allowed me to make changes before I downloaded the pictures onto my computer when I got home
Well I really bought it to have some fun with
I don't mind the flash position that everyone seems to dislike
Love it
Multi-mode IS does well for low-light (less shake in the results)* Good results (in auto or "P" modes) with high-contrast shots like shooting directly into sunlight
My wife and I had been in the market for some time for a high-quality, relatively easy-to-use camera that would be especially great for non-professionals like us who like taking quality travel/nature photos and has good zoom
You have to find that entry in the menu or else the camera will not work under these conditions unlike most other DSLR's in which you just mount these adapters and that's it
It is much lighter and smaller than the A37
I'm very impressed with the quality of the images I've taken so far
While I like the camera very much, it still has the problem of the battery blinking during video taking
although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
Pros: Prints great pictures with stylish borders
I also like the slightly raised Video button and its location
This is a bridge camera and not a dslr so with that in mind, this camera for the money is the best you can do
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
Very simple easy to use, lightweight, and it takes good quality photos
Great compact camera that probably rivals entry level DSLR models
Excellent
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
I couldn't use it the entire trip
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
I got some cool pictures of Carlsbad Caverns in NM which are minimally lit
Took about 60 pics and some video with 1 fully charged battery (still have some battery left)
The flip out adjustable screen makes it easy to keep steady for zoom shots
it's the lens
if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
This was a good purchase
She is very familiar with various cameras since she has been very much into photography for the last 15 years
The a3000 (also a5000) are probably just what the serious but cheap amateur needs - a second body
I printed out the online manual which yielded 204 pages
Shipped quickly
The camera even recognizes how many people are in the frame by placing a square over each face to focus
She loves it
The eyepiece view finder is just ok but I prefer to shoot with this rather than the 3&#34; LCD viewer
LOVE THIS CAMERA
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
This is quite a nice little camera
It goes everywhere and after two years is showing a little external wear
So i decided to give it a try and buy this one, since 20
They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
got this as it flew off the shelves.
4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
This year I came to terms with the "you get what you pay for" sentiment and decided I would buy a GOOD camera because it is worth the extra $50 or $100 to have the fantastic quality
i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
The 20X zoom on the SX280 was good, the 30X on the SX700 is even better and gives me better photos of distant objects
Canon take note:  I'd love a camera with Less options for those of us who just want to stick mostly to Auto but better low light photos & a panorama option
Original review:The FZ70 seemed really exciting on paper, but in reality the picture quality was disappointing
The price is $... more.
The manual that came with it is pretty basic
Fantastic camera
I was pretty disappointed and decided to return it
I'm new to this camera and new to super zoom cameras, but likewhat I've seen so far
This camera is about the nostalgia of a Polaroid exposure with slightly better picture quality and the luxury of choosing which photos you want to print
My daughter requested this product last year for x mas but unfortunately I could not find it
It's really high rez
First the tilt able screen is an awesome new feature for those low to ground shots
When you've reached the end of your pan, just release the shutter button
It takes awesome landscapes in low power/wide angle (my favorite pics to take) with awesome colors, crisp and sharp
this makes a great pocket camera
Love this product
Low light performance seems quite good
The centre button is no longer customisable
The pictures are unbelievable and the videos are great
It takes beautiful photos, crisp and clear
I wanted to be able to take great pictures of my family and friends, etc
Thank you to Amazon for undoing my mistake
First thing is that I had preordered it and the price changed by the time I had delivery
APS-C chip, interchangeable lenses, hot shoe, 1/250th sync for flash, decent AF speed and accuracy in good light
I thought this camera was very well priced also
Notice I said make better photos instead of take better photos that is because by learning how shutter speed and aperture work together you will be able to create photos where regular point-and-shoot cameras would fail
the HD is so TRUE [used it for almost anything] The built in mic is no good, but with external mic, you'll get an awesome video in HD
We on a cruise and this took great picture way our there
However, it has a few minor downsides which are minor, but regular annoyances
i agree with the positive reviews .
I ordered 2 Transcend 8g and 4G class 6 cards with camera
Will be taking it on our Europe trip later on this summer
Now in the book it says something about pushing the button halfway down and the focus button
Very nice camera
great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
Other than that, I love this camera.
This camera is bulletproof.
I'm still getting to know how it works, so it'll be awhile before I become a novice
Would recommend this camera
Even with the lens touching an object, I was able to get sharp focus
Anyway, it's really nice quality and very durable
I have four (4) of them, all "basic" point and shoot
Very satisfied with the camera and the transaction with Amazon
Downloads easily to iMac
The built in flash on this camera (like almost all built in flashes) is harsh distributing light unevenly
Like that I can replace batteries immediately and don't have to wait and charge them
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
I'm not asking for professional quality here, but it should at least be as good as my iPhone, if not better
It looks very much like the rest
The zoom was incredible as I was able to get some really close in shots of the gator's eyes and hide
My FZ150 has a 25mm wide and this camera appears to take in approx
This is about the 20th digital camera I've purchased, and other than the rugged pentax optio that I bought a couple of years ago, this is the ONLY ONE that does not have an ORIENTATION SENSOR
Great camera for the price
The only complain I have is that the camera is not suitable for fast moving objects like sports
He completely loves it, I can said is a good camera, nice with panoramic pictures (totally worth it)
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
Beyond those few features, I found the camera to be relatively lackluster and uninspiring
I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
She was thrilled
User beware and remember to bring several extra batteries for long photo shoots
I bought 3 of these for my kids
Some photos do not show up because they are too high resolution (12MP is where I maxed out
four megapixels is great .
The FZ-70 packs a lot of features, including panoramic and RAW capabilities
But really, this is a still image camera and it takes very good images for not a lot of money
This camera has similar or even better quality than the entry level DSLR, but definitely less solid than mid-range or full frame ones (Nikon D90, Canon 7D, 5D Mark
it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
The image quality is just ok as a point and shoot and the real fun of the camera is the printer
Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
-Sam
They are not the same, and the T5 is less expensive, though certainly a GREAT "entry level" DSLR
This camera goes from a super wide angle perfect for shooting in small rooms to zooming far away fast
You can get great deals on this camera since the 9100 came out which is basically the same camera with more zoom
And yes I used a tripod as well (which did help and got the rate up to 15%)
I bought this camera just in time for my birthday bash and, overall, it increased the night's fun by the 2nd power
Anyway, Canon has upgraded the battery capacity so we were able to shoot 12 hour days touring the park at multiple stops without swapping batteries, however, I did disable GPS and NFC radios to avoid drain from those features
There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
Great Deal Great Camera
it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
This little camera worked great
While there are enough automatic modes and settings to keep you busy learning until the unit is obsolete and it has to be replaced, the manual mode settings are limited
I've never been so amused as I have been while trying to find things to record in slow-mo
Exactly what we were looking for in a reasonably priced high quality compact camera
I bought this camera to use for my wedding
The 60X optical zoom produces fuzzy unusable pictures at the high end of the zoom
price7
the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
It was fun experimenting with the different scene modes at dusk
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
I like this one much better
It only shoots at 3
I had high hopes for this camera as a simple one for my wife to use
Unlike many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas.
Remarkable closeups
Not too hard to steady with image stabilization, but with practice I will get even better
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
only complaint-the neck strap is kind of narrow and uncomfortable, but that's an easy fix
It can easily handle a 16 GB memory card, and it also automatically connects to the computer for uploading pictures
Convenient case by the way
Great point-and-shoot with simple to use options
Makes the foray from automatic cameras and point & shoots almost effortless
First, let me say that I am not terribly techy
Cons if you call them that:-I am still worried that the lens is going to stick out, but i clean it daily and it hasnt stuck yet
I was looking to replace my aging Kodak and decided on this camera after months of searching and reading online reviews
I like AUTO+ because you still have control over some items like exposure
I haven't been disappointed
flaws ?
I have few digital cameras, but this one is the best ever
The zoom? WOW I was really impressed
Love this camera
FZ70 Review
Very wrong.
I think I'll stick to Canon's from now on (my two Canon SLRs (film and digital)still work beautifully)
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
camera
Hey Guys, The thing has a MOTOR that works the zoom
Overall  nice camera with many excellent features
Sometimes when you edit out noise, information is lost, and when I really zoom in on the photos produced at low ISO's, I think some sharpness has often been lost, and I wish the camera would leave these photos grainier, as it's always possible to edit them (sometimes better than the camera could itself) after the fact, but it's not possible to get back what's lost
Not comfortable to handle
I was hoping it might be 75% as good but sadly it's more like 25% in our indoor photos
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
It has a grip that I could comfortably wrap my fingers around
Love the Camera
I am an experienced photographer and normally use a full-size DSLR (D300s, D200, etc
Lens is capable enough too
Best coolpix I ever had
I also have a SonyDSC-HX20v with a 20x zoom, and I think the panasonic is easier to focus at the highest zoom than the Sony is - however both require a steady hand at full zoom
The features are more trouble to access on the menu,  but may get easier with time and use
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
Five Stars
What a joke
This camera takes crisp quality pictures
they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
We used it for my Mom's Christmas card photo and they turned out really nice
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
He took great shots
Two annoying things though (and I'm sure it was to cut down on cost
right?  Also, some may "gently" suggest that I quit whining and splurge on a DSLR or something - and I would agree - but I've seen pictures from a point-n-shoot Canon SX120 of kids in dimly lit rooms and they came out sharp every time
I have and will continue to recommend this fine camera to all interested folks
This camera exceeded my expectations
Reasonably good coverage, though direct flash is never flattering for anything other than fill-flash
in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
great &#34;bridge&#34; type camera
Something I wouldnt have to make an insurance claim on if it were lost or stolen
All in all I am very satisfied
The app then connects to the phone and applies the tag based on date/time
Overall for it's size though it's tough to beat this
I have used this camera for both photos and video recording
consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
Its the worst camera ever pictures quality are the worst and everything about this camera is a joke
(BTW - Vivatar makes cheap higher capacity batteries for this camera I later discovered) Overall, this camera is large for a pocket camera and fairly heavy but it is packed with features and a great zoom that honestly is at the limit of being functional at full zoom (30x max zoom requires bracing your arms to stay on target)
Not even close to a D3, but I wanted a camera to leave in the car all the time
Takes great pictures and videos
It replaces another Nikon camera that I dropped
based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
I am not sure ,but think some of the difference is lens quality between the two cameras
you will be very pleased with the images
BEFORE I removed the protective film on the screen, I used some Xylol with a Q tip to rub the lettering off, and left the film on
My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
She points and shoots and it is perfect, from outdoor action shots to indoor birthday parties in low light
You get a beautiful pan shot
I was very pleased with the images I got
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
AND it's all in a cute little compact package
Another fault was when I tried to work with RAW on my MAC
Battery life remains decent but it's somewhat shorter than the T3
If you shoot video, the microphone's sound gathering capability will adjust with the zoom lens's focal length, so that even when you zoom in, you can get good sound from a distance
this compact Nikon arrived today and it took all of 3 minutes to prepare it and turn it on, which is as quick as claimed
I've been using this camera for a few months now.
Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
It is light, 16 mp and the zoom is fantastic
Sony is a good name so Feel fairly safe that it will fill the bill
I took picture 384 then tried to turn the camera off
The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
No issues in this department
The first was the L810, I didn't like that one because my images were getting scrambled when i used the review function so I was pissed but decided to give Nikon a second chance and bought the S8100
cameras capture moments .
I always carry it in a protective hardcase
So far after a few months of owning this unit, I have no issues and am having fun with it
We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
at this point i would not recommend it to anyone
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
Good zoom I'm happy
Three Stars
On the head-shoulder shots, you could see Adam Levine's frown lines and crows feet, no noise, it was awesome
an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
You do get a few cool options, like color selection when taking photos, and a few frames when you print the pictures
Poor quality photos even with the more expensive photo paper
Guess Nikon hasn't figured out how to make a good  10x zoom lens weigh less than a  gram, darn those guys
After researching the Sony A3000, I was really shocked to find it at the price I bought it for
I got it a little over a year ago, and I should have returned it from the get-go
This camera takes photos every bit as sharp and detailed as the Panasonic FZ150 or FZ200 camera and is as good as the Canon SX50 in sharpness as well
expensive
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
If you're recording something silent, you can hear the zoom a little, but isn't that true with all video cameras?  This camera also has a great feature for slow motion videos
How does one know camera leaks oil?  The rotten scent emitted from oil in the chamber produces unique stinky scent, which is undeniably Nikon
the instruction sheet is in very fine print
Nice looking camera, inexpensive, average photos
0 inch view
Great camera that takes great pictures
Since there is no in-camera panorama or panorama guide, the axial shift means a need to be conscientious about the framing and focal length choices
i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
The T5 has a fixed screen like the T3
You would think the batteries weigh the camera down but nope, this camera is small and light
Come on -- please --somebody build a high quality small format for the days the SLR can't go
Poor quality for zoom
Finding your target in the zoom mode is a little difficult, and takes some getting used to, camera shake can cause some problems, but overall it is an excellent camera
This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
I am very happy with the Polaroid and reccomend it highly to folks who don't take themselves too seriously
But otherwise, this camera is great
It takes great pictures, is a good size, and works quickly
The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
because this camera is beautiful .
You really don't need a telescopic lens when you have this unit
if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
The wide 20mm lens helps, as does the f2
Oh, BTW, (as others point out) the USB cover FEELs flimsy (I couldn't really care less about this
The quality of both still images and video is excellent
There are so many automatically correcting, errors features that it is well nigh impossible to NOT get a perfect photo
the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .
Great product
To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
we purchased this camera when we took a trip to Alaska
Canon does a decent job balancing out noise, noise reduction, and detail retention in the JPEGS as you go up the ISO scale
Excellent Product from SONY at an unbelievable Price
I bought this camera from another retailer because it was available before Amazon
this IS the one
It works great
the pictures are small but cute
Nikon L830
made the camera totally inoperable .
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars-is because it doesn't have an automatic flash
next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
Control layout is largely unchanged and remains pretty straight-forward to operate
The Canon sx superzoom series of digital cameras have consistently delivered terrific image quality in good lighting in a pocket sized camera
Its two items; a camera and printer compressed into one
yes, a Sony
for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
This is a great choice for $277, it's got a great zoom lens and takes clear photos
The VIDEO EDITING  software that comes with it is very good
For the past week, I've been reading the manual from cover to cover both learning what this camera can do along with deciphering all the technical lingo
This camera takes quality pictures for its price point
Great zoom camera
The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
right where your left finger holds the camera
And the cool thing is you can get a lot of different lenses relatively cheap for these Canon cameras
I can hardly wait to take this camera on my next trip
The battery has great endurance
I went back to the Cannon SX130IS which is a much better camera
It does very well with totally automatic as well with aperture and time control
3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
I was not disappointed
Very good contrast
Pretty cool camera although the quality of photos are pretty messy
I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
I don't believe I would have achieved this with my heavier 5Dmkiii with the 24-105mm with IS
The video also has more artifacts than the NEX or alpha cameras
AMAZING zoom
I have been taking a lot of nice pictures and I'm improving every time
Nikon COOLPIX L830 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera is the greatest camera ever
And for the video, if you leave it set to continuous AF, when you play it back you can hear the focus mechanism clicking over and over again to regain focus
A3000 does have plenty of manual modes like most entry level DSLRs and mirrorless cameras
Excellent Camera
my pda becames a digital album .
It's a really good choice
No matter what the lighting is, it seems like every shot I take with this camera is blurry
I have seen numerous samples from other 16MP Sony sensors, but this 20MP sensor has much higher grain/noise and tendency to show lot more hot pixels
I would give it 5 stars but the flash is right where I would normally put my left hand when holding it so you have to adjust how you hold it so that the flash can pop up
Great Price
I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
I will buy a mirror-less soon, but for the time being this is a great camera
I love that the camera has a digital screen on the back not like the old polaroid cameras where you have to peek through a hole to see what you are photographing
Really love this camera
It's just some of the coloring that is off when they print, but it takes great digital pictures and I have always wanted a Polaroid and this one does the trick for my price range
The camera fits into a standard camera case
Color is very good
This camera was purchased for a disabled person who has tendency to drop things
Super handy and great quality
It is a fun gadget but quality of the camera and prints could be better
Flash pop up is new but getting use to it
I primary do landscape/birds
This has necessitated retaking some pictures where the flash was not fully up
The lack of a lens hood is an issue, especially when you have a lot of light using the zoom
It is extremely enjoyable to take pictures with this even for a novice like me
This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
Called Amazon and explained the problem and the very polite lady credited my account with the difference
This camera is the best I've ever owned
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
I can still put the camera in my pocket without too much bulk
Personally I love it! It's a definite 10!
really nice for wide angle photos, which is why I bought it
Steady hand needed
There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
The colors are great and the zoom is wonderful
It's very awkward and I always worry about people touching it when I'm passing the camera around
Many of my birding friends who have them
So, bottom line?  Excellent camera
sure .
It is hard to find any faults with the overall layout of the camera
I am very please with my purchase of the Nikon COOLPIX L830
This is not my primary digital camera
It takes great pictures and is simple to use
buy this camera and savour it .
The 1080p HD video is records is unbelievable, then plug the camera right into the TV via HDMI and watch video or view pictures
Got this for my wife
Ah, my little camera
Well, I think that for the most part, I may not be using them much anymore (except for macro work)
I was so excited and it doesn't work
UPDATE: After using this camera for nearly 6-months, I am still VERY happy with it and the pictures it produces - and would be glad to share some of the shots
All is good with this camera thus far
i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
This camera was very user friendly and the quality of the photos was great too
Once the flash is open, it's easy to remember where not to place your finger and cover the flash
very large pics take 8mb each !
Great little camera
it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
I'm still learning settings
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
excellent camera, the zoom is amazing, plus its effects on photographs very useful, I am delighted with my camera, I recommend
Awesome 30X optical zoom, fast processing and lots of features
Bummer
Buy one & go out and take some amazing photos
Controls are easy and intuitive
This camera takes series of photos and processes the best image
For me though, if I had to choose between purchasing this camera and the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX30V, the Cyber-shot would be the hands down winner
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
On the physical positive side the shape of the grip is excellent
Having fun with this camera
I really liked it and was finally getting into to the point where I could switch back and forth between settings, and could anticipate what setting I'd need for the best picture
I needed a good camera to take photos of prom and other activities that my daughter has and this camera was truly great for that purpose
This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
will be taking to sons college graduation
I'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted.
I feel so  PROFESSIONAL when that whopping zoom goes out
this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
Just point, zoom and shoot
I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
I haven't read all the instructions and have only used the automatic mode but we've been happy with the quality of the pictures
My only complaint, which ill agree with someone else on
Once unplugged the camera would shut off and not turn on
the battery charger is almost half size of the camera
Additionally it has an effective anti-shake capability, making tripods for long shots not always necessary
My guess is the camera will perform wonderfully for both stills and video
i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
It shipped fast
Softer than the F3Previously in Auto mode, the Nex won't allow you to change shooting mode via the custom buttons; you have to go through the menu system
I downloaded to may tablet and read a feature and try it on the camera
Still, I'm happy with my purchase and hope to get good use out of the camera
I have owned quite a few digital cameras over the last ten years
The pictures certainly told a more vivid story
Holding the camera still at maximum zoom is always an issue - you need a tripod to get a clear picture, but when the conditions are right you can get that perfect shot with this camera
try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
I just returned from a 3 week vacation to three national parks
i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
One thing the camera does NOT have is wifi access
Takes good pictures - minor low light issues, but after 10 months the lens cover (plastic pieces slide over lens when closed, supposed to slide away when open), is no longer opening
A super big disappointment
It is bulky, but it is a camera, and certainly not as bad as a DSLR plus lenses, etc
Both cameras are excellent in low light without a flash,  but in this scenario I think the Fuji has slighlty less noise and a teensy bit better color saturation
The best mirrorless camera I've used to-date
Small, easy-to-use, takes great photos and is relatively easy to transfer to a PC
Noise control seems well done at lower ISO's and is usually not noticeable in casual viewing
The students LOVE watching their photos print out
Video quality and sound is also very good
Just recently purchased this camera and was excited about using it but had problems with this at my daughters wedding
The quality of my pictures are extremely good, maybe a whisker short of digital SLR type cameras
The best thing about it is the light weight of it, pretty convenient to carry
Sometimes it is slow to focus in real dark scenes
I am really happy to have it
i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
Includes some filters & frames on the camera itself
He verified the FZ60 has the Leica lens, but it "appeared" the FZ70 did not
(4) Writing images, even with a high speed memory card, is very slow
Twilight mode is slow when it has to take multiple shots and combine the pictures into one
The metal housing seems very rugged.
However, the two features that caused me to buy this camera are a huge disappointment
Great product for point and shoot and fun that it prints
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
The camera does all I need and wanted
Son's Christmas Gift
The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
There are a couple of things I did not like
In real estate we make pictures in vacant houses with no power and this is a great asset
Most of them are blurry
however, it is an older version
I was hoping to get a point-n'-shoot camera that would take wonderful pictures better than my current Panasonic or Nikon P
Nice camera for the price
review by Larry Ponziani
I also used it for night portraits and they turned out fine, too
And re the view finder, or the flat screen on the back, if you find these a problem, you never worked in the old days where all we had was a ground glass viewer
most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
I am very happy with most aspects of the camera although I haven't had time to thoroughly evaluate it
I don't know why this sensor has so much noise compared to the Fuji
Even the burst shots, HDR and the lowlight shots are quick, you dont even notice how many shots the camera has taken until they process and merge for the final product
This is one model that does not allow for a remote shutter release
Great camera
The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
I'd say that this camera is perfect.
So far I am absolutely thrilled and hopeful
Before purchasing this polaroid I heard some negative reviews due to the &#34;chunkiness&#34; of the camera or the bad quality photos, although I have found no such issue
I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
(5) Continuous shooting mode, while very fast, only supports 5 photos at once
I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
First off, I am very happy with my purchase
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
2) Flash can easily wash out the subject if you are too close
the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
I bought a 64gig chip for it
I will update this as I use the camera more
i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
great colors , pictures and white balance .
Spend the money and get a DSLR with a good lens or two
its definitely not the best I've experienced
It takes excellent pictures and the video quality is really stunning
8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
I'm going to return this and check out the amazon reviews to try a different camera, any recommendations for good cameras for taking sport shots??
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
Fantastic clarity and detail (even when I zoom in on my computer)
I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
I was willing to sacrifice some additional weight and size to get that
Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
I recommend this camera to anyone
I am in love with my camera
The integrated microphone provides surprisingly good audio
The camera operates very easy, if you have used a digital camera in the past this should be no different
seriously ! i love it !
The printing does work, but as others have mentioned, the printing function kills the battery
The zoom has an autofocus which truly does work
For my company I was the designated photographer for one of our events and they wanted me to use this particular one so that customers can also get a copy
Excited at the beginning but get bored and limited by the product
i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
No manual controls: I didn't buy this for the manual controls (its a point & shoot remember, get your Binford 5000 25pound mucho $$$ rig out for the tricky stuff), I just want to whip it out,  take pictures and video, and it does that well
It was great as long as it was working
I have called Cannon they are sending me an RFA-- I will let you know if they treat me well or otherwise.
I also own a Nikon D300
These do not affect the resulting photos and videos
this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
First thing you'll notice - this camera can deal with low-light like no other compact camera
Photos are superb
All round I am extremely pleased with camera: handles well and feels solid and chunky but not too heavy
Good price
The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
Perfect pic
I gave my daughter this camera for Xmas and we love it
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
I contacted Panasonic and was not happy with the response
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
All you get is a fleeting warning before the battery dies
I researched hybrid all-in-ones for weeks and finally settled on this model - for the money there is none better
when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
I think this is the bergain of the century
Just what  wanted
Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
The T5 has a much more comfortable grip and feels more solid in the hand
Good Camera
Anyway, it may sound like I'm nitpicking but it is a pretty good p&s
The other downside is the video: It does take good video quality, but the mic picks up the zoom and auto focus
I love it
there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
I wanted something a little more sophisticated than a point and shoot and this camera is terrific
Weight: yes it weighs a little more but feels solid
The interchangeable lenses, compatible with the Nex series, make this truly versatile and a great entry into the prosumer market
All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
And with the fact you can use interchangeable lenses you can really start to do some amazing things with your video
I will never buy another brand again
WORST CAMERA EVER
Pushing the magnification beyond the optical limitations, the FZ70's quality deteriorates much, much more rapidly than the Canon
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
But for the serious amateur,  I think that it is certainly worth investing a couple hundred more to move up from the typical point and shoot to this camera
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
I also find using AA batteries easier and less expensive than proprietary batteries
An extra memory card allows to take more pictures
Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
The COOLPIX L830 is a very sophisticated camera for the price
IT IS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN I AM USE TO, BUT I REALLY LIKE IT
I bought the camera because of its zoom
My beef with this camera started the very first time I turned it on
00 off, if purchased with this camera
Here's my update
Will make good pictures in low light situations and in total darkness if necessary
the nikon 's are great cameras .
The mirrorless A3000 is lightweight, in my opinion as comfortable in that regard as any bridge I have tested
and NO WI FI SIGNAL IS NEEDED
this is probably user-idiocy but I cannot figure out how to view/play images without the lens being engaged
I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
It also got a new front grip which makes one-hand shooting more convenient, even when shooting video, since the Video button was moved from the back to the top and you can now use your thumb solely for holding the camera
I bought this camera for my mother
I have read reports of pattern noise from sensor in videos from A3000 by other reviewers
See comment number 4 below
I'll keep searching or wait for a similar upcoming product to come out
personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
There are alot, I mean alot of variables you can do with this camera, but if all your interested in is point and shoot then it does that very well as thats all my wife is interested in
I love them
It's rather a Sony's NEX camera in a SLR body
I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
Included software lets you make a JPEG from movie frame
Not As good as my FZ200
Easy to Use and awesome close-ups
A great little camera, but I returned for a Panasonic w/ viewfinder
I am very pleased with the COOLPIX L830
However, I may have to buy another camera anyway as my friend doesn't want to part with the S8100
I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
It's especially perfect for slipping into my purse to have for any kind of unexpected opportunity to take photos
Also in full wide angle there is a very slight interference but a slight zoom out from full wide angle and that fixes that
Obviously I received defective equipment
This is a replacement from the P O S that was a Nikon
I purchased this Panasonic LUMIX Digital Camera for my husband, as a Christmas gift
0-Inch LCD (Black)
I will say in their favor that the pics are extremely good but the two items above make my experience go sour
I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
We tried to shoot various live action sports with it and it does its 5 shots in the first second or so of pushing the button, then we are stuck again for another minute, at which point if we didn't get the shot in the first 5 shots, your screwed
Nothing wrong, just not that great
Those are my three main reasons why these canon cameras are the BEST for new photographers and even videographers nowadays
Taking pictures of objects at a distance is no problem for this camera
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
I read about it in the NYTimes, which made it sound like manna from heaven
waste of money
Some more manual control would have been nice.
At any rate I will keep the lens hood and just screw it in as needed and not tighten it so it can be removed quickly
Blur blur blur blur blur
- I wish there was no EVF, so that the camera could have been just a bit more compact
Color rendition showed no red or blue fringing, I noticed with other products, even pushing 20-30's in our lab from a sub 400
Sharpness is not an issue and color is very accurate, better than average for sure
I only shoot with Panasonic, video or photo and have never had a problem
it is going digital but this product can't even provide basic standard quality of digital images
Close up is awesome
Will keep working with it but don't think this should have to happen
And then finally on that dial there is the magic M and that is manual mode and that's where you get to set the shutter speed and aperture for yourself
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
OK, so I bought this camera from Amazon, great service from them, only had this camera 2 days so this is just a first impression
It goes out in a couple or few years and then you send it in to get it &#34;repaired&#34; not knowing what happened
This camera is great for all ages
Beautiful picture
i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
positives
The screen and viewfinder also aren't quite up to par, which makes determining perfect focus or reviewing photos a bit more of a challenge
The first time this happened, i was very tempted to take it back
I have been VERY HAPPY with my purchase
I highly recommended
However the users manual is practically worthless
It took decent picture at short and medium focus lengths
6 SHOTS w DIFFERENT EFFECTS w 1 push of the shutter release
] This camera is a quality product and I bought it despite, or because of the Ashton Kutcher commercials(I'm not too sure)
Picture quality on auto and scene was marginal
Great "Multipurpose" and  Small Digital Camera
My wife loves the camera
The camera is fine, but I ordered the wrong thing
i always shoot using the lcd panel .
i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
I used it (for 1st time) at my son's college graduation with excellent results
First of all, throw out the batteries that come with the camera
lens is attached so no head for changes lens
Great camera
If you can get past those two things, this is a great choice
It also comes with an adaptor that plugs into a standard wall outlet
Several reviewers mentioned soft pictures at the 1000 to 1200mm end of the zoom range
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
Great compact and effective
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
My smartphone might do better in low light
Pictures taken in low light with no flash come out beautiful as well - in fact, I haven't used the flash on it yet
The images were superb and the ease of operation was perfect for my armature skill level
Cons: No high-speed-shutter scene mode, which makes this unacceptable for my travel camera
Flash coverage was good for portrait situations
The FZ70 does many things well: it has a great zoom, the buttons for control of the features are easy to reach, even when your eye is pressed to the viewfinder (after a bit of practice), and has enough stabilization to allow sharp, handheld photos at full optical magnification
com say they will fit the somewhat more "square" geometry of the S8100 in point-and-shoot pouches designed for the Lumix or Elph
The video is very good although not great
Much better than my FZ150
-Powers up and is ready to shoot at the blink of an eye
i've tried the polaroid 300 and didn't care for it either
Only thing is can't figure out how to take a pic without the red flash even if I turn off red eye function
In VIDEO mode the ZOOM is very gentle, like at 1/4 regular speed
It feels very sturdy in my hand
Camera does everything I wanted it to do
You pay for what you get, and this pocket size camera is worth every penny
If you are looking for telephoto capability my recommendation is walk before you run - this camera is good but only if you are familiar with bracing techniques, manual ISO setting, and tripod use
The camera focuses very fast
Takes great pictures
The 30x optical zoom (with digital extension up to 120x) is astonishing
The reason I gave it 4 stars is night shooting isn't what I would like it to be, the camera case sometimes opens up on the top, and the battery is very poor even more so if for any reason you use the flash I highly recommend getting a backup battery for it
The photos are to soft and Just out of focus on the ones I tried
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
I really dislike the on/off switch
Having said that, it by no means feels rugged
It ran on batteries so after taking about 1100 pics on a trip around the world I passed it on to a friend who is still using it
its size is smaller and good for travel
Its intelligent auto mode is actually pretty sharp, picking the appropriate mode (portrait, landscape, night time portrait, low light, etc
I am having fun zooming in on very small images from across the room
warning - i did read the manual !
Really amazing, my expensive 60D doesn't do any better even though I am using the viewfinder and holding the camera steady against my head
Have used the camera already, and find it to be everything it should be
Five Stars
This picture and video quality are superb
Canon says it's normal.
The zoom is phenomenal
We took it on vacation and then found you have to look at the monitor on the back to frame the shot
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
The straps were extremely difficult to attach to the camera
Is it a Leica?  Doesn't say Leica on the lens like my old FZ7 and frankly for the quality of the pictures I'm getting it doesn't matter but that little L on the camera body
BUT I REALLY LIKE
LOLIt really is a great camera
I quite like the product
the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
I finally ended up returning after I looked a bit online and noticed that this was a common problem
all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
This adjustment is very important to people who wear glasses, as the adjustment range is good enough to make it so that many people who wear glasses will be able to shoot without glasses
The viewfinder remains the same
Better make me happy
i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
Great camera for the money
Awesome photos, a couple of reservations
It is compact and lightweight which makes a great take on trips
the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
The zoom seems fine as well
For someone who doesn't need professional pictures, this is a wonderful camera
I was able to use it to capture my 2 year old son opening Christmas presents, and almost NONE of the photos are blurry, despite the fact that he was moving constantly
I also would rather have a "slide on/off" button like on the FZ50 than the type that is on the FZ70
No complaints whatsoever
What they don't tell you is that the camera uses some type of proprietary RAW2 format
Great camera
It takes incredible pictures and the quality is excellent
the sx280)
I love the camera
This is an awesome camera
I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good camera that is simple to use
I have a 50x zoom camera also-but I tend to use this one most of the time-because I can stick it in my purse or pocket-which I can't do with my other one
Really like the different ways it can be used
Flash is not this camera's strong suit in any case
what's not to like?First, here's what I've learned since acquiring this camera: even though it can accommodate interchangeable lenses and has an apparently conventional viewfinder, it is NOT a DSLR
If I'm shooting RAW, I want RAW only, adding JPGs just reduces available cache and storage and increases write time
This is arguably one of the best APS-C sensors I have seen
This camera has new technology for its "night portrait" mode
i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
Mine died after only 2 days
But with digital screen you can see and just take picture again under some light
And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness.
Took this camera on a trip and absolutely loved the use of it in the canyons and on my favorite trails
I like this LUMIX a lot and after all these years of juggling between phones and point-and-shoot and DSLRs for 'serious' events or happenings, I may just stick with the 'bridge' because it's so much fun to use while giving me almost everything I could squeeze out of a DSLR and often more: incredible zoom power, movies and microphone quality, flexibility in setting picture format and resolution
camera readily available from local pawn shop?Unlike 30 year old Kodak, this Nikon junk probably leaks oil, but sensor is so tiny, hardly any oil lands in the sensor area
Until I order that card reader, I have to use a friend's laptop which has a built in SD card reader and move files to a flash drive, and back to my computer, which is a hassle
i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of " juice " .
I am NOT a professional protographer
Just something to get used to
Best Compact Point and Shoot
3), RAW, DPOF for photos, MPO for 3D and AVCHD and MP4 for movies- Photo resolution from 480x480 up to 4608x3456- Video from 640x480 to 1920x1080 at 30 fps- Tripod socket and flash horseshoe (there is a built-in flash, of course)- Relatively easy to navigate menus (must invest some time if you're a first time LUMIX user)- Nice image processing capabilities- Several levels of 'ease of use' from nearly full automatic to allowing you to set everything the way you want it
Take a picture of a full moon with full zoom
I think it will give me some great close up actions shots this summer on the lake
i love photography .
Wow zoom
So Far The Best Pictures but Still Somewhat Weak In Low Light
Wrong, except that my problems are different.
All the good reviews for the SD500 are true.
Low Noise
My fiancee and I were very happy about buying this camera after doing our research
The good:Colours are very accurate - better than my Nex 3
60x optical zoom is impressive and very sharp, but what is even most impressive is the digital zoom
The placement is absurd
Highly recommend this camera
The FZ70 takes, IMHO, excellent pictures and video
It is a very good camera, but I wouldn't say it's the best in its class
It takes a little more time but that's fine with me
This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
Haven't found any large flaws yet
It takes great pictures
I couldn't see the point in getting another t3 so I read up on Canon's other models
I am very happy with my purchase
The best value, and the biggest zoom range of them all
In efforts to make the camera as small as possible, Canon has offered not much more than a token bump in the case
The AI setting does a great job even in low light conditions, it's easy to use, and battery life is excellent
Love this little camera
Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the photo quality
The picture quality is decent and, in good lighting, very good
Great camera-just what I was looking for and at a great price
Canon -- by far the best camera made at all levels
I tried the camera for basketball and soccer and maybe got 5% useable pictures, the rest were blurry
These are all the flaws I found in the camera,
You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
I have this T5 but it stays in bag when doing shots
bright and clear and sounds has definitely been improved over my previous Panasonic
I am somewhat disappointed in the burst mode of this camera
The video focus will hunt a TINY bit when zooming, but, this camera WILL zoom during video, unlike others
I can't say enough about this camera
Missing features&#8230;
Excellent price point for a camera of this caliber
This camera can do a lot of things that others cannot with such a low cost
Amazing camera
I gave four stars rather than five because I would have preferred a rechargeable battery
i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
and it has a 3D option to use while taking videos
Simple to use the camera's many functions
Great pictures, not fuzzy, no distortion, even when I've zoomed it to the max
The camera responce is VERY quick.
These photos demonstrate shots from very slow motion up to very fast motion
if anyone has any good ideas for us please let me know
The A3000 is definitely a step forward from the smaller NEX bodies and outperforms them in some aspects including response
It has a slight darkness to it but it has an option to brighten your picture however, the image looks distorted
i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .
not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
but this isn't what your interested in
MUCH TO LEARN BUT THE AUTOMATIC SETTING CAN DO MOST OF WHAT IS NEEDED
On the other hand I can make it do more complex things
Photos have nice clarity
Owner's manual not very good, online very complex yet doesn't explain things very well
an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into " out of battery " situation .
This is the best I've seen a superzoom do with standard indoor lighting
However, issues (for me):- this camera is much bulkier than my Canon
Wonderful little camera
i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
shutter sound5
I purchased the DMC-FZ70 after several weeks of research and I must say I am very impressed
I love it
Interchangeable lens can be a game-changer for someone interested in raising their photographic capabilities and the NEX mount lens catalog is fairly large
I find the extremes between other reviewers ratings interesting since I have not experienced many of the negatives mentioned and have experienced most of the positive remarks
Horrible
The Nikon Coolpix S8100 is an okay little camera
I never sent it it to get it &#34;repaired&#34; for a whole 200 dollars
The quality of the instant prints are just fine
Definitely a good investment.
the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
I worked in a camera shop for 5 years and handled plenty of entry-level DSLR's (including the original A33 and A55 SLTs), and this feels no less capable durable than any of those
you have nothing to lose and much to gain
The image stabilization system is EXCELLENT
Fantastic camera - great pictures / video
Awesome little camera that takes great pics
shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
The manual is excellent and well constructed
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
It won't do as well in low light situations when compared to cameras with larger sensors, but the pictures and videos are still very good to excellent
In particular in bright sunlight I could not see the picture well enough for precise cpmpositions
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
Could use stronger zoom
This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
Critiques:1) Flash is in a weird spot - placed right where I would steady the camera with my non-dominant hand
This is stupidly under priced
pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
Only problem is the film has to be purchased online
It will cause a ring/vignette
In auto mode, the image quality is great even though it is apparently capped off at Fine (the camera can take pictures with Superfine quality in other modes)
the panorama photos are flawlessly stitched and consistent due in part to the Panorama 5 software that comes with the camera
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
However, I was unhappy with pictures taken in low-light
Such A Small Package
HD video is captured in the
The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
it uses a MOS sensor which is much more accurate and clear than CMOS that is used everywhere
I have also had some of the digital printed and they are very nice
After reading several reviews that talked about poor image quality, especially low light images, I was hesitant to buy
I also like the lens cover
Will take a shot of one view and convert it into five or six other versions
I plan on exchanging it
Can be extended by dimming the screen and turning off the setting to keep the focus motor going
Good, but not as great as competitors
It is very small and portable, you can bring this camera anywhere you go
3 ) 4x zoom is nice
I needed this camera for my trip to Germany in the fall, I have two other SONY Cameras the A77 and the A99 which are the full size DSLR's with two pieces of Carl Zeiss glass and lots of toys
It could be a GREAT camera with the following: variable speed zoom, manual aperatue and manual shutter speed, and a viewfinder for those sunny days
The battery life is not very good
Bulky, ok camera
Here are some useful facts:-
Its perfect for its size and may I add INSTANT PRINTING? Thats right
Need a tripod for that zoom level
The optical zoom isn't very good, its not exactly zooming in
YOU CAN BE a artistic pro with the CREATIVE SHOT option which with 1 push of the shutter button gives you 6 different shots, with different effects, and different crops and zooms
I did a lot of research and bought the Case-Logic case, which is perfect for the camera, and an extra battery or soft bristled brush to dust off the lens housing before stowing it away
Great little camera
Even at max zoom, the auto focus can compensate for my hands, the pictures are very clear and crisp, and it does pretty decent video too
Although I have had this camera for only a few weeks, I must say the FZ70 is one of the best values in digital camera
It even exposes the flash correctly
If you aren't overly concerned with printing pictures of larger size this camera will fit your needs
The sensor produces clean and relatively noise-free images up to about 3200 ISO before introducing slight noise
Then came the S8100 Nikon ; Built like a brick,
We purchased primarily because we were heading to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks for our honeymoon and wanted something that could zoom (30x) far for those distant shots of potential wildlife
Nikon will not cover under warranty, wants $100 to repair a $200 camera, that's approx 4 months old
It really was a pleasure to just take pictures without having to think about it
I've been a Canon fan for years and we have two others besides this one
yep .
Oh, and the zoom is beyond awesome, love it
Oh and I love the deep red color
I had some difficulty with the panoramic pictures
0 port and it cannot send data at it's full capacity, and says this for every USB port on my tower
I am not even an avid photo-bug
after reading the review,  as was said only 2 things missing on this camera, wi-fi & moveable display
This camera is state of the art  "overall" , in terms of price, versatility & quality
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
The scene settings are very thorough - you can choose between night time / day time / sports and many more
I stepped outside and just snapped about 4-5 photos before coming in and downloading
I wound up with a Sony
Lovely camera, I love it, 5 out of 5
I asked to one guy take a picture of us and he couldn`t believe how good was the camera and he asked me where I bought it
The print quality with the zoom is quite good
As far as the zoom lens, most of the zoom range was unattainable with handheld use
A promising camera that under-delivers
one i really like is the &#34;single color&#34; mode where you can take a photo of a person wearing a ball cap, and make the ball cap the only thing in color with the rest of the photo in BW
Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
I was nervous when I received it because my camera experience has been a smartphone
Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls.
As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
And being able to have instant photos
Love Nikon
I have only had it a couple days but I love it
You can also shoot stills while recording
I believe mine may have been one of the rare defective items that occasionally escape quality control
We have taken about 50 pictures and so far it has been great
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
A new high-resolution 922K, 3" display
My wife likes the point and shoot without thinking part and I feel it has enough shooting modes and settings that I can take professional quality pictures
This camera doesnt zoom but I was able to transfer my SD card from another camera into this one and it printed the zoomed in photos
There are many modes available, some actually useful, and some interesting in-camera editing capabilities for those who wish to do that
, then I think this FZ70 represents the current "state of the art" in affordable bridge cameras
Does not come with an SD card, so you'll need to purchase one
I also recommend not using the continuous AF (you'll hear clicking sounds in the video)
9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
Ooops, I goofed
The lens and screen are clear as a bell, the telescopic movement is swift, the video is marvelously simple to start and stop, viewing the video is clear and the sound is super
It has tons of extra features for a p&s; and it the perfect companion to my D60
I haven't figured out how to take good action photos though
-The pop-up flash was really inconvenient
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
so far so good
I ended up buying a Sony 14
