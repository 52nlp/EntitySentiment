HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
 FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature.
Also all the required cables and what not.
 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
 For this reason, it is very easy to drop.
 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours.
there was very little light in there .
:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.
 A sound decision and a happy customer right here!
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
scroll bar :
Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.
 If you want to add more, just delete some that you haven't been listening to recently.
The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.
The battery has a long life.
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
So, if you don't won't to void your warranty, you will have to get in touch with Creative, they will send you a rma number, fix your Zen, but you lose all of your dogon music.
Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.
This proprietory software to download.
b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
 These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one.
 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
It's so small.
yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
Overall this play is my introduction into the market.
The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer.
most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too.
eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
 Although iPods have been around for a few years, they didn't really get hot until now.
it was not my first choice .
Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.
Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.
If you absolutely, positively need over 2,000 songs for your next wolverine photo shoot, get a 10 GB player.
 The outlook is a little clunky to use on the ipod, but it is functional.
the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
the menus are very easy to navigate .
I just don't like it, the weird thing is, I don't know why I dislike it.
) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired.
You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
want the laundry list of reasons why ?
Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.
Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
it 's a very intuitive program .
ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
5.
Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one.
  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch.
If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
pro : 1 .
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
likes
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
 CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier.
.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
 Talk about convenience.
And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.
However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod.
final verdict :
  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless.
this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
that 's probably a bad thing .
The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.
first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
this is possible ! !
I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
Also, I don't like how when I first set up my iPod, it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation, it will not configure the iPod, and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod, and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod "hard drive" to a new letter.
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
iRiver's battery lasts four to five years.
  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
gee ... thanks a lot creative .
   The 'click wheel' is much easier to use, compared to the previous generation's models with the touch screen.
i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
This is really a no brainer.
So that's the one I bought.
The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.
It may not top the iPod Mini, but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality.
software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
it happened to me once .
* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.
- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
A trick I used was to manually capitalize all the info.
Overall, I am very pleased with it.
I promptly gave the included earbuds to my wife, I'm using a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise-canceling headphones with the Zen Micro.
construction quality is a difficult item .
The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.
d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company.
this is ridiculous .
i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
but the major problem i had was with the software .
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations.
the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
i will just say this :
the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???
 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.
This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.
the battery is nice .
( batteries last longer too ! )
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.
conclusion :
There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners.
no issues as of yet
This appears to prevent the lockup issue.
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
 It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files.
I have the black one and adore it.
do n't drop this unit :
 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one.
I use my iPod all the time.
it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
Check out message boards on Napster for more info.
i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .
It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music.
Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.
  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
I expected this coming from Creative.
working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! !
 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.
Doing what, you ask?
i 've had no problems with the software .
by the way , it looks nice also .
Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).
 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.
the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
whereas some folks have the " ipod " , i have the " nomad jukebox zen xtra " ( not to be confused with the " nomad jukebox zen nx " ) .
size and style :
so what are you waiting for ?
I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.
it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
Finally I upgraded the firmware and log in to Napster.
Apple needs to step it up and get better, longer lasting batteries.
3 ) user replaceable battery
Originally I was only getting around 8 hours of playtime out of my Zen Micro, but now I consistently get 10-13.
software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.
Check the Zen's S/N ratio and DB rating.
 The only problem is the battery life.
That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.
details :
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
software :
2.
At 128 the songs sound very good.
i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
 I love my new iPod!
if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
it can get pretty lonely out there .
finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.
 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
The first install did not work correctly and would never transfer music to the iPod (but did allow me to register with Apple and load songs into iTunes).
An Apple Ipod Mini was considered.
the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
I've been ZETAZEN long before this player came into existence...lol and my player's name is ZETAZEN.
The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.
The Great And Versatile iPod	 I love my iPod!
I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.
It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.
i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .
3 .
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
It also comes with a case so you can either stand it up or use a belt clip.
However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.
transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
 PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.
I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.
FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod.
I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).
So my first MP3 player purchase was incorrect.
Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?
However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
Apple, on the other hand, seems to have engaged in a blind marketing strategy that seeks to obliterate competition through utter abuse of marketing channels and un-orthodox "free player" schemes that just seem to pimp the product without pimping the features.
makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod.
i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
 The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.
so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
The world of MP3 players is blinding, and since most people don't understand the technology [myself included], user-friendliness is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
i bought this only to have it break within a month .
1 .
The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great.
 Really easy to use.
It is exactly the same size as my flip phone.
The accesories that come with the player are great.
I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
Like I said, I've had my ipod for six short months and I'd estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most.
the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad).
) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
 I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.
SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.
 You  will need a computer with a six-pin FireWire or USB 2.0 port (USB 1.1
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.
i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
pros :
 Doesn't have alot of good games on it.
I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.
despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
 Not that anybody would revert back to their old-skool walkman just because you can knock it around more.
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
the storage capacity is great .
karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
third party software to the rescue
It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it.
also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .
 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
cons :
**I honestly don't see the point of buying songs from iTunes when there are so many free alternatives.
4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .
one major complaint :
Aren't they something of digital sound experts?
- you just have to buy a new player .
i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .
Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).
i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
the bottom line :
 However, you should still buy an iPod!
2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
It's just my personal advice but you're saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod, it's very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything.
zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
Don't get this...keep browsing.
this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable.
my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
Tough as nails.
price :
  All in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.
Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files.
It COULD have been a great product.
No comparison in my opinion.
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
God Save Apple	 I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac.
the controls definately took some getting used to .
Games-- not really important, but existant
installed software .
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.
I'm glad I did.
Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums.
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
There's got to be a better solution...
It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.
overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.
to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch.
song transfers were not an issue .
I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!
I also experimented with an adapter for the car.
 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.
transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while.
lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it.
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
cheaper in every way .
great design and looks cool .
in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the " now playing " screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
 You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!
Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.
The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.
now we come to the zen xtra .. .
i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
It holds plenty of songs.
Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.
so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
controls are a bit awkward .
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up.
Hard drive screws up occasionally
This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
Looks?
This is by far my biggest complaint.
you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the " next track " or " previous track " button .
First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.
)  Compatibility?
I'll talk more about that later.
 i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
 With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive.
the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
The first battery charge lasted only about six hours.
to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features.
the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.
zen good points :
while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.
It allows fast and easy navigation.
Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.
I'm guessing the more features you enable, the more the battery will drain.
What compels you to choose one over the other?
but who wants the wires involved .
You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
this player is an ideal purchase .
not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC.
as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
i was a little disappointed in the low end .
It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
Buyer beware!
based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
3 .
 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
So the download was much slower.
When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.
6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
And if you read the description on Creative's site, it does mention that the "actual battery life will vary with use."
 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
weird .
i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
then sorting the files is easy as pie .
