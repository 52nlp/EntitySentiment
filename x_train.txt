operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
In terms of video quality I can confirm what another reviewer referred to as &#34;fixed patter noise&#34; to be an issue
Not an Expert, But an Enthusiast
I highly recommend this camera! I can shoot continuous 640x480 60 fps video until my 1gig SD card fills up!
Good quality and fun!
The 60x zoom hand held pictures are amazing
I t has the perfect size and
So take my review for what its worth
I haven't taken a bad picture with it yet
This will be an amazing step up for people who are accustomed to using a point-and-shoot camera
I have not even tried all the features yet
i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
The zoom is wonderful
Put the batteries that came with it in, and shot a T ball game, senior pictures for a friend, and went to a local botanical garden since I received it on Thursday, and still has plenty of juice left
You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
You will need to brace properly or use a tripod for best results, but in a pinch, handheld can be done, the OIS works well
Light to carry
So far a GOOD solid VERY SMALL (for 10x) Zoom Auto Point and Shoot - But doesn't over come the laws of physics
This is my 4th digital camera and it is by far the best I have ever used
I am sure there are other features, video for example, that are better in the new models
) when shooting special projects, but often don't want to take all that gear along when I travel
I bought this camera because it was supposed to be fast and take good low light pictures
I recently bought this to replace a Lumix G3
The softness of the kit lens is quite evident when paired with the T5
I wanted something to be not to small nor too big, and I think this camera is just what I was looking for
Only complaint is the weird little flash that pops up under your fingers, but that's not a big deal once it's open
I'm really upset about that
no instructions .
Feels good in your hand and easy to handle
10x zoom is great for shooting the types of photo's I need to shoot
Great in low light
Zoom works really well, better than expected
I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
Great birthday present
it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to " get into " it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
this was a pretty good buy
Note that the 3&#34; LCD view screen is not bad at all
The only problems I've run into is I didn't realize there was no manual mode, and when its at its highest zoom it make a beeping nose( does not interfere with video)
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
And over the last five years Canon digital SLR cameras have become very capable of 1080p high definition video cameras also
I am not a professional, but this camera makes me look like one
in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
The Lumix DMC-FZ70 provides an awesome midpoint between an SLR and your typical point and shoot that was greatly being overlooked
Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
We took this great little camera on a trip to Mexico not long ago and it was awesome
Love love loveeeeee
Perfect for kids sporting events
Battery life is ok, more than 250 pictures with a full charge and the camera always on
One of the best buys around all things considered, especially for those who shoot wildlife
I'm new at photography, but this camera is so easy to operate
However, I've used this camera on a family vac and really have no complaints about using batteries
The picture quality is fantastic
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
Comes with multiple settings already programed and easy enough to play with other settings
Love the Nikon Coolpix S8100
if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
The various levels of megapixel quality is great
Although the model is considerably big, I have used original Polaroid models and I love this one so much better
But a good camera for the price
The photos it takes are of stunning quality
I'm using a 16GB Class 10 card
The other 2 things that I'm not happy with, is the charging system and no manual mode
However, if you're looking for the best camera to take to a concert for example, this is it
Thanks for the input on the past gens that helped my purchase decision
I wish the wide zoom (30mm) was better but it's ok
A nice camera to use easy to handle takes great pictures used it at a family gathering a few weeks after getting it
It wouldn't be fair of me to leave a "full" product review yet since I'm still learning about some of the features on the camera
If you follow the tips and step-by-step above even if you just use the lens included you will get better at photography
The quality of the pictures isn't perfect, but they are good enough
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
We took it on vacation with us and on the 3rd day I got a "lens error"
So I decided to upgrade, not to a professional camera, but to a better one
For the recent few years Canon has made great efforts to improve their travel-zoom compact cameras, and the new SX700 is their next remarkable achievement on that way
Great that you can pick and choose which pics to print
The zoom capability is amazing
My daughter Loves taking pictures with this camera
I  shot some video in the same dim light and objects near the light source are great
* Almost the same battery (NB-6LH) as for SX280 (NB-6L) - old one works fine
I also changed the picture resolutions to try, but I was still not happy with the results
8 II Camera LensThe best part about this amazing lens is that it's less than $100
In conclusion, the image quality is excellent on this camera aside from the aforementioned sensor noise
A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
Plus here again, you can shoot your video with special effects
I also like that the pictures are also stickers
Thankfully the store that I bought the camera was able to give me my Money Back
Fabulous zoom
I don't mind the slighly large size
The camera did not ship and most of the accessories already have
worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
The pictures are coming out very nice
The viewer on the back Is a good 3 inches to view your subject but your photos also
It is certainly worth the money
Awesome pictures
When the camera is turned ON, there is a strange noise that never stops but increases when the lens is extended
If you take a number of photos even in moderately quick succession, and then close the camera, you often have to wait several seconds, which is a bit annoying
Once you do, you will never turn it off
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
I would rather buy a nice camera and take the time to have it printed
Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
I was looking for new camera that took nice close-ups of family as well as my crafts
go get it .
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom
I love this camera
i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
The Sony A3000 is the answer to your dreams if you don't want have the time to learn to shoot a DSLR but want something better than a point and shoot camera
I'll start with the strengths
This camera accepts both standard SD cards or Sony's proprietary Memory Stick form factors
I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
On the bright side, having everything in focus is usually ideal for family or documentary photos
i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
All are well made and do what you would expect
we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
The 20mm wide shots are amazing
The macro took great pictures of flowers and the detail was awesome
I was able to get close-ups and distance shots with one camera
Easy to work
The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
lens changable
Read all the reviews on cnet and it's definitely recommended
Have not tried video
&#34;2, The functions are good, but the body feels cheap because it is very light
i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
In auto modes, the A3000 can produce some very good photos
I like the feature that corrects for camera shake, as I had sometimes had blurry photos with my older camera and this is much improved with the Sony
Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web.
Not only for the specifications that I wanted, but also, for the affordable price, that included accessories, this Digital camera
Time from power-on to first shot is good
GoodThe zoom works wellThe camera is smallIt has a rechargeable lithium battery
3)to take low light pictures without flash I have had to use the continuous feature rather that the low light or party setting which both use flash
Random errors
High speed shooting is definitely not a strength; it's not recommended for birding unless you're comfortable being very persistent and are prepared to shoot A LOT, which is unacceptable to most birders
All you need to do is hook the cable to the USB port on your computer and let it charge
I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
The user interface is simple, fast, and easy to navigate
I bought this camera for my gf since she always wanted one that has the ability to print pictures - but after using it on several occasions I wish I got one that you have to wait for the picture to show up on the paper
i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
Nikon Coolpix S8100 12
her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
- battery must be charged in camera, which means attached to the cord
I don't know why the nav keys can both spin and be pressed
Very disappointing
my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
Great for zoom
I have a video camera for video
And there is no lens hood
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
I dropped my Canon Powershot S80 & got this to replace it
And, I liked the Nikon's tilted screen
Okay, here's what I hate about this camera:Pros:1) When it takes a good shot it takes a good shot
The best camera I ever own
Low light video also very good, but there is one setting in video the 1080 without the star where the video looks dull
3) Have to change the battery IN the camera
Wonderful first camera or as a step up without spending big bucks
Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
I'm still trying to figure out the other features because there is so many
software for editing a little &#34;lax&#34;, but over-all very good for home use
I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
All of the shots are very awesome
As I see it the benefits are:(1) Small size--small enough to fit, in the case, in a large pocket, or out of the case, in a much smaller one
Great so far, awesome zoom, good quality and sharpness; still playing with some of the features
I suspect that is because the lens is changeable - but I have been used to the lens cover coming with a safety cord
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
I returned mine about 2 days after i got it  it was not worth the money
Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
Amazing camera and I've only scratched the surface of what it can do
at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
2)User friendly memory
For fun only and not for good quality print
Amazing Camera but No Manual Mode
It is very easy to use and very compact with professional quality pictures
You can download the pictures using USB without having to take the memory card out
anyway, I could not get passed it
The 300HS is a basic auto camera that fits very nicely in my pants pocket
Or you can shoot at the 16MP and go to 60x and get a great shot
I put in the extra memory chip, tho
Can't rate higher than 4 stars because I haven't used this camera
Daughter's First  Camera
i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
The charging system means you have to leave the battery in the camera to charge it
This camera produced better pictures than my friend's Rebel
Very good image quality/Good feature set for the price
Highly recommended
Image quality is very good
I've had it for about a month and it is simply the best point-and-shoot your money can buy.
There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
the g3 looks like a work of art !
I do not like the position of the button to video
This is a camera that is not exciting in the respect that it doesn't have a lot of high tech bells and whistles but it does do well in the primary aspect in which you would expect a camera to perform well, which is taking nice photos
okay
I love this camera
This was purchased as a gift
Took it out for a test shoot today
No one does true color better than Nikon, and its AUTO mode is off the charts spot-on, even for difficult shots in weird light with subtle effects (sun pooling through a forest canopy, for example, or dusk on a street as the neon lights come on)
Some nice features, nice to be able to print pictures
excellent range of metering options as well .
The charger didn't work
The failure of this S8100 was also at a very bad time as it is at the beginning of time with grandsons from the Mid West
The camera takes the best zoom pictures
Was looking for a small camera with a great zoom and this is it
Sony has implemented this quite successfully by borrowing the same feature from the NEX product line
That pricepoint is just laughable
on a HD memory card, because a regular memory card was not capable of filming it
This is the lastest purchase for me in the PowerShot line of cameras
love this camera
The camera has very good image stabilization which is essential for shooting at slower shutter speeds especially at longer telephoto settings
4) It is a battery eater
At the wide-angle end, the optics are unflattering for portraits (more than SLR wide-angles)
HOW APERTURE AND SHUTTER SPEED WORK: (The following was taken from my 50mm lens review but it walks you through understanding shutter speed and aperture)Here I'll explain how the f-stop or aperture priority works on digital SLR cameras
I don't mind the cheap plasticy feel of the device nor the rather limited feature set compared to most other point-and-shoot cameras
Auto scene mode doesn't pick the right scene indoors in low light (wants to use night landscape), use Regular Auto in that situation
Therefor, I am returning it for a refund
This camera has broken twice on me
Although small, it is still better than noneIt has a mode dial like a real dSLR
I like the Powerful 30x Optical Zoom in this camera
The zoom is great, and the auto focus works better than any point and shoot that I've seen
this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
I'm better off taking pictures with my regular camera and making wallet prints at Costco
The only minor complaint I have is that it doesn't seem to have an option to recharge the battery using the USB cable, meaning that you have to pack yet another battery charger on a long trip
My last camera was a Canon power shot
I can still continue video but am not sure how long I have
in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
Polaroid Bad Business Policy
I am so impressed with this camera
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
The issue is with the audio
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
The Lumix DMC-FZ70 right out of the box an amazing point and shoot camera and becomes an even more awesome camera when you really start digging into it
To me the Canon EOS Rebel line of DSLR cameras are the best for those wanting to get into more advanced photography
A backward stepIt is still difficult to find functions in the menu system
It's a good camera for amatures
Pictures look great on big flat screen TV's
the red is gorgeous, which is a plus, a deep shimmery black cherry sort of color
Comes with a decent kit lens that alone should have cost 200$
However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes.
this is a great camera for you !
Bought this as a Christmas present and the recipient didn't like the quality
It was much better than the 28
I hope Canon fixes the GPS tagging app so it uses less battery on the phone
With the included lens installed it weighs just over 16 ounces
I've only found online stores that sell it
Battery is Useless
you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
All around a great camera for an amateur like me
It's not a deal breaker and it's not that bad, but just be aware that you can hear the zoom
and by using manual exposure, I could see right there exactly the middle exposure for the HDR
I have now been able to take videos of the sunset with out that "white light" line or I think it is called light sheer
Replacing a four year old Canon
The photo's are cloudy and hazed and you don't get a really good image
An awesome camera for the price
Very effective optical Intelligent Image Stabilization for stills
It's also easy to download photos - software was easy to install and easy to use
canon 's g3 does it consistently .
although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
Many have mentioned build and photo quality
She loves it - compact, clear pictures, very convenient, easy to store in pocket or purse
If it cant focus it flashes a red parentheses around the subject and doesnt shoot
I think the minimalist nature (and not minimalist in the same way as a Leica, obviously) is very nice
my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
That camera is a horsew and buggy compared this one
An extra step I wish I didn't have to remember to do
I was not expecting too much considering the extreme zoom and the price, but it takes very good shots even on iA
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
I tested this camera on the auto mode and it has totally impressed me
This is very cumbersome
This camera is truly an exceptional value
In fact, I don't use this camera with auto focus lenses ever
the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
She  has shown  interest in photography  and wanted her &#34;first real camera&#34;
this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
I saw some reviews where this camera did not need a flash at all in dark environments
But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
The quick shutter speed if great for kids sports
The super wide angle is rather unique in a super zoom and great for landscapes and indoor shots
As a 3D VXF hobbyist, I especially like the auto HDR mode and the bracketed modes
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
This is my first digital camera and I think its awesome
For example, I took a picture our of a car window, and the edges of the side view mirror (integral to the picture) have lines across them
Amazing
It's also pretty heavy at 11 ounces with battery and printing paper
Simply put - the BEST FOR YOUR MONEY
And, I was very happy with the quality of those pictures
I prefer adjusting the zoom by hand instead of the power driven zoom
I tried all the cards with the (card) slide switches in both positions and the S8100 would not function, only with it's built-in internal memory
Bit harder to shoot at the long end, of course, but hand held shots can be done, which is amazing at that focal length
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
well, this is the perfect camera
Better than expected
Back lit CMOS, where have you been all my life?
Second, it doesn't come with a separate battery charger, so, if you have a spare battery, you have to use the camera to charge it, which is not as convenient
Definitely not worth the $$$
you can just take regular digital camera and print em at cvs or something and will have better quality photos
Just What We Wanted
Owned for a few weeks now
But after a gorgeous sunset that i caputred with 7 shots and fitted to a panorama
The picture and sound are so much better
Disappointing
I've never owned a compact camera anywhere near as fantastic as this camera
It only worked when the camera was plugged in
Excellent camera
However, when I look at the resulting shot, even those taken with the lens fully zoomed out, I see no evidence of the camera shake that I know existed
I knew that the scenery there would be more than I imagined
The paper is a bit expensive but what I love about this Polaroid instant camera over other instant cameras (by Fujifilm etc
Help
Besides that
My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
But with prices on DSLRs having come down so much it's really hard to see why someone would stick with the limitations of the technology in this camera versus just paying a bit more and getting a camera that will far out-perform it in terms of image quality, speed of autofocus, lens options, etc
and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
I think this camera offers unparalleled value in its category
The biggest problem with the video is that you can hear the noise of the zoom when you zoom in & out during video shooting
it is a little bit heavier and bigger than what I had expected a mirrorless camera would be, but still way lighter and smaller than a regular DSLR
photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
Awesome Price for a Great Camera
Great Camera for the price
This camera can't be compared to DSLR's but rather is a good bargain in a bridge camera
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
The FZ70 focuses quickly and well and renders tones smoothly
It feels very solid
Not sure how much video space that is as I have not taken any video yet (therefore have not rated the video in this review)
I wanted something far more portable that did not require a camera bag when traveling, biking and hiking
I had a larger more professional 7mp camera in the past and found myself leaving it behind when I went places with my wife and kids
-Battery Life lasts me about 2 weeks, and ever patrol i go on i am taking pictures, my job requires it
The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't have a viewfinder, which I don't remember seeing in the description at all
Light weight great zoom no changing lenses
However, if high-resolution, sharp, clear images that capture the beauty of nature in its most realistic rendering is a priority for you, as it is for me, your best bet is to by a used FZ 40, or a FZ 35
Let's me take the great extreme telephoto & wide angle shots with little WA distortion & minor chromatic aberration at extreme tele
UPDATE:  Still very happy and the quality of the photos is exactly what I hoped for
Photography has always been about compensating and adjusting
May also need a little bit more post production work during the stitching process
the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
Aloha
I suspect that is because there *isn't* very much to it
night mode is clear as day .
Low light is very good for a compact, but don't expect miracles
The images are sharp and the colors are beautiful
Great camera that I`ve ever seen
i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
These are some of her best shots
Even I can take decent pictures with this camera
You dont have the convenience of a &#34;pocket&#34; point and shoot, but the picture quality is a lot better than the Canon pocket camera I had
:)I recently recorded my sons bastkeball game and the video was great
With that much zoom I can take photos of birds farther away than I could before
Great pix
The flash comes up automatically but needs to be manually pressed down to be closed
( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
owned this camera for roughly 3 months and now its not working I keep getting a lens error and the camera has never been dropped
The photos taken in low light are fantastic; much better than I would have imaged
What I like about the Fuji and the Sony, though is that they are small enough to fit in a purse - whereas this Panasonic most definitely is not
if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
An A++!!!
We bought this camera to replace our three year old one
I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
Easily fits in pants pocket
Zoom is awesome
3- USB kicks!
I think the one most important issue I've noticed is for all its power, the batteries seem to last forever
Am totally happy with it
This is a replacement of my SX260
grainy, cluttered, blurry
The manual is huge, since there are so many capabilities of this camera
Unfortunately, I have to rate the viewfinder on this camera as poor to marginal
Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
, without going through menu
The battery doesn't last all that long, especially if you print out your pictures, and I don't see why anyone would buy this camera, if they didn't expect to print pictures directly from the camera
Taking pictures of stationary targets, the camera handles gracefully down to 1/5th of a second, which I find absolutely remarkable
i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
Still small enough to fit into your pocket
I bought this camera as a replacement for my wife's Kodak Easy Share
That being said, comparing to my partner's Canon SX50, a few limitations have made themselves clear
I look for it in Amazon marketplace and the Nikon S8100 is it
The motor noise is hardly noticable
great gift
You can even print multiple copies
Nice photo quality
This is a great camera
picture this :
I love using the L830 its easy and I enjoy using the built in effects
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
I'm not going to bore you with repeating statistics and features many contributors do
Come to think of it, all photo software from camera manufacturers is lousy
Wanted RED, who doesn't???  Found it here and love, love, love this camera
I can take pictures so much faster than before and don't have to wait to look at the picture or for it it process
Some time in this process the camera got scratched and glare spots appeared on pictures where light hit the lens
Nice
It tends to run out faster when I am just in a printing  session and unfortunately taking out the camera battery deletes the date/time setting, which you have to set before being able to take pictures
This camera doesn't fully satisfy my needs and I'm overall a little disappointed
No real contenders in its size / price range
Using it mostly in the AI and Scenery modes
Other wise this is an amazing camera
Oh, get it from Amazon too bc it's way cheaper
i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
What I especially liked:-The picture quality in general-The 30X zoom has surprisingly low chromatic aberration
after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
so I passed on it
i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
I used it this weekend comfortably with a Black Rapid wrist strap
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
I did extensive research before buying - I had never had anything but a Canon in the point-and-shoot category before
Most super zoom cameras have a zoom range of 24X to 50X, and the wide end usually starts at 24 mm or 28 mm
Although there are some modes I am still trying to get a hang off which come off a bit difficult to use
Just isn't fast enough and I always get a blur
My Yongnuo-560II cannot fit in because of the big built-in flash housing next to the hot shoe
My indoor use consisted of walking around at the convention center here in San Antonio for the Auto Show
I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when they had the meeting to create this model A3000 cuz it ain't an NEX and it really ain't a full on Alpha series camera either
To find similar resolution from another camera you'll have to pay $450 or more
I recommend it to everyone
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
In previous cameras I have owned the battery has lasted much longer
We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
I Was wrong.
A little on the small side but the photos are great
Smart Camera
in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
After using a Canon for a number of years, I was pushed away from Canon by the fact that their newer cameras have an unusually slow continuous shooting mode
Absolutely PHENOMENAL
I also upped the rgb one notch toward red as well as the vividness it one or two notches depending on lighting
It all depends what you're looking for, of course, but if you want something that takes very, very good pictures but for whatever reason you can't handle the weight and size of the DLSR, this camera is an excellent compromise
Great for the price but lacks for video
Otherwise LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT
i love the camera since the day that i saw it, is really easy to use i didn't have any problem with the camera, the only thing is when you print the pic thre is a space in the end of the paper that is not good is weird
I love the option of taking videos
Its functionality in indoor light situations is much better than my previous Lumix cameras
OK
Sony could have just made this camera w/o the EVF, so that the body could have been a bit more compact
For one thing, I like having 2 batteries that I can charge and swap
20
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
I has a Cannon One Shot prior to the Coolpix that got stolen
Charge lasts a long time
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
400$? Really? Sony is surely losing money on this camera
When I looked at the image on m computer screen, I can actually see the pixel noises
The picture quality is the best I have seen in any camera I have ever used
After reading a lot of the reviews on Amazon and other places on the web, as well as watching too many You Tube videos, I came to the conclusion that the FZ70 would be a good, affordable  replacement for my aging 35mm Cannon SLR
other times the picture quality is great but that is very minor
The FZ70 60x zoom is a bit much, anything beyond 25x probably needs a tripod
I would like to see future models have WIFI and viewer for your eye
It i truly an excellent camera with very powerful features and almost all DSLR type capabilities which you will need to capture the special moments in your daily life
WHY?  Why why why do they do this?  I suppose it's to be able to have a USB charger but for me this is really annoying
Low light shots were surprisingly clear and sharp as well
The autofocus tracked accurately and silently, and the auto white balance always kept the colors true
It is amazing
However, if the shallow grip doesn't bother you and you want the newer kit lens plus the touch screen, by all means, get the Rebel SL1
* A new Noise Reduction algorithm is more aggressive on low-contrast areas
One odd thing is that when the camera is turned on there is a very soft continuous sound coming from the camera when you are doing nothing with it
This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
I do wish it had the wifi capabilities like some newer models but this is a great option for beginners like me
From the prospective of the image resolution, it is nice to step up from the prior 12 MP to the new 16 MP especially for landscape photos, what allows to present more fine details and to make your pictures to look more natural than before
In bright indoor lighting, it may be  better to use aperture priority mode, choose the largest aperture available (3
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
I've seen much more expensive cameras that deliver a fraction of this camera's abilities and aren't as easy to use
Great purchase
a friend got this same camera (from Best Buy) and it quit working properly within about a month
It clearly picks up all of the tick tick sounds of the the lens as it focuses
Great for starters
The Sony Alpha 3000 is a hybrid camera that combines the internals and lens mount of its NEX line with the look and feel of a DSLR
I was able to get a little bit, but nothing very impressive
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
Indoor movement (gym situations) with zoom is difficult to achieve
Great so far
When I hold the camera, my thump seems to always touch that button, will have to work on different thumb placement
Love the 3D settings, the panorama settings, everything
great very wide and long angle telephoto lens
It is not by any means for serious photographers or anyone that wants to take a family portrait
Great Camera at this price point
i have not got around to reading the instructions, the fine print is hard to see,i have a  best friend that has one so will get him to get me started
 I went out and got the Canon today.
My photos are getting incredible
way cool
It is light-weight (Compared to my D300) and has a wealth of built-in controls to handle a variety of picture taking situations
Got it for about $200, and I won't stay awake at night about it being in the car
Poor Image Quality and Clunky Design
i didnt wait to experiment .
However, I had a few others doing the photography with me didn't have a steady hand and even though that there's an anti shake it still didn't help them
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
Easy to use, fun to explore the settings, takes amazing photos, and it was a GREAT price
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
Having a Leica lens makes it the Cadillac of point and shoots
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
Not chintzy at all
Spectacular camera, terrible computer interface
I am currently experimenting with a third-party flash and I continue to be impressed by my output's quality and the ease of getting it that way
The colors are fantastic on the pictures that I print although they are a little bit off they are still very accurate
anybody can explain that ?
Although the SX700 is a pocket camera, it is a little bigger than most small cameras including previous models (i
Much sharper, better balanced than any pictures I have ever taken
What you gain over the entry level NEX3 is the EVF which is nice for framing in broad daylight
But believe me, it's well worth it.
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
Low quality camera
always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
I would not recommend this camera
Horrible
Very happy with my purchase
Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras.
This Camera Horrible
not so much here
the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
The short videos were excellent quality and meant I didn't need to lug my video camera along
Like it
She had to end the last days of her vacation taking pictures with lenses shadowing in the pictures
Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
In fact I am still trying to figure out how to change the f
About one in ten photos was acceptable, a problem compounded by the fact this was hard to determine until the photos were downloaded and viewed on the computer
I'm having so much fun taking pictures with my new camera; it is very easy to handle and simple to use
recurring problem with battery
CONCLUSIONSThe Lumix DMC-FZ70 is a surprisingly good value
Great camera for a great price
Sony products are the best of the best
I took shots of water propulsion system in action from 1/4 mile away and they all came out great
They come in handy when I don't want to use my smartphone for better image quality
It seems you have to double click some of the time, but not all of the time.
go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
I've had similar cameras and for the amount of photos I've taken I would have gone through 2-3 battery changes, and I'm still on the first set of batteries
Good color & contrast, even with piles of snow
The photos keep turning out blue
Totally true
3- Battery is charged through USB cable and if you get spare battery it requires swapping back and forth (Battery life is not good either)I am thinking of returning this camera eventhough I like Coolpix over Sony or Cannon but I think there are set backs on this one
Excellent value for money
So I think I'll keep it
Have people telling me wow what a nice camera and people commenting on how nice the pictures are
but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
Also, I would not expect a great deal from the image stabilization
All of my photos have turned out great and it's so easy to use
Panasonic is using a strange folders naming on the SD card where the video clips are hiding
WONDERFULL
I recommend this product 100%
Nikon Coolpix L830 - Great Camera for the Price
We bought this camera in anticipation of a trip to Alaska,  we are thrilled with the ease of use and quality of the photos
I could not be more pleased
Takes great pictures
Fun for what it is
It has 10x optical zoom plus around 4x digital
The weight of the camera is a nice beefy feeling, and makes you aware that you have a camera in your hands
It is also difficult to get clear focus when using the zoom
Good inexpensive long zoom camera
When the FZ 35 came out the following year, I bought it
Easy use and good pics
Have been using it for wildlife and birds recently and the zoom makes for some great photos
The only drawback is the LCD and EVF are not eye controlled like on the A37
If you're deciding to buy one of the instant print cameras I recommend you keep looking
hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
Professional quality pictures by an inexperienced photographer
i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
Great camera for the price
I an very happywith my choice of camera
then it just wouldnt print at all, even when i wanted it too
Sent camera to Nikon, Nikon claims camera is `damaged'(100 images, maybe, max, since holiday
The camera is also VERY user-friendly
Took great pictures
Takes good photos, printing is fun
just wish it worked
Both of our point and shoots suffered from being dropped and broken battery doors
Handing has greatly improved on the T5 over the T3
In decent light or with flash, the photo quality is amazing for a 400 dollar camera
I haven't actually used it yet, but it's a Nikon, need I say more? Love the red color and the size
Very disappointing, not what I was used to from Amazon
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
I can't wait to use this on our Alaska trip, the reason I sprung for a new camera this year
My mechanically deficient wife is using it so much that I believe I will have to get another for myself
Of course, at $200, this is a pretty expensive toy - mine has been on a shelf for months and it doesn't look like a need is going to come up for me to want to use it again
This camera is not what I expected
it fits perfectly
I am a hands on person and learn better by experimenting with the camera than reading the instruction manual
it's not my first choice in cameras,
It functions very well
In Manual mode the few available buttons have to pull double duty and getting everything setup takes some time
Great photo quality, but durability sucks
Shooting won't take much more time
I took the camera on vacation and loved having it
By far the Nikon Coolpix S8100 is the best compact point and shoot I have ever used
I have used this camera for about two weeks now and I love this camera
Excellent camera
Also some great bird shots using mid tele in overcast situation - still great photos
What I really love is the quality of pictures this camera will take
This camera has excelllent battery life
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
i took this on a cruise and caught pic's of flying fish between the waves
Thirdly, I didn't like the grip on the camera
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
I definitely recommend it
The Price is Right
Decent camera but I returned it
Did I mention the pictures in a dimly-lit room come out blurry?  I had to return it
I miss the "flipping the screen" option that is on the FZ50
The best thing about this camera, is that you can literally just pick it up and shoot the picture and get gorgeous results, the second best thing about it is the zoom - at 60x you can zoom to your hearts content
for that price this camera its awesomethe quality  of  the picture is pretty good you take a very cool picture in the night with out flashyou can install external flash and lens on the camera its lightcharging its little tricky but you can buy external battery charger to charge the batter quickly
really like this camera
With the zoom, I got all kinds of great photos of the animals from a distance, very sharp too, some photos look almost as good as my husband's digital SLR with longer lens
Hey, guess what?
No problems getting started and no problems with the photo software that came with it
The equivalent of a "Blue Screen of Death" on Windows operating systems
I bought this to use on a trip to the Amazon to spot animals, figuring I will need the zoom to take good photos of them up in the trees and in a distance
we change settings and do all we can but the picture looks red through the camera eye and thephoto comes out red
This old school camera is perfect for preserving memories and instant prints
Well worth the cost
The main complaint I have is the picture quality
Happy wife,happy life
Easy to use
It focuses pretty fast, faster, I think, than the FZ47
Performance-wise, the camera's colors consistently look good and the camera consistently produces pictures that look natural
That is quite a claim, but I be leave it's true
Image quality is very good
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
Replacement Camera
5fps) and doesn't stop until you release the button
Easy to Use
I've only dropped this digital camera once within the year & half I had it & it is still working perfectly like it did day one plus no dings or scratches either
Love This Camera
Because of my incredible busy lifestyle, I have not used it a tremendous amount of time
- Exposure compensation button has been removed - its now difficult to find and use
The picture was breathtaking
-Battery life: I wouldn't call it miserable like other reviewers, but it doesn't last a long day; I suggest you to buy a spare
I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
Since April, I've replaced them three times
Expected better from a $500 unit.
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
This camera makes it simple
totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
Can't wait to use it on our vacation and take just amazing pictures
If the photos weren't so great, I would have seriously thought about returning it
Took it on a trip to Oregon and using it much
 am so glad I bought this camera.
All have taken nice pictures in well lit situations
but that was what we were looking for
the distortion is not a flaw .
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
Excellent camera
i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
I did not want to deal with multiple lenses but wanted a step up from my Cannon with a 20X optical zoom
The body is still plastic but the materials are higher end this time around and you actually get a proper textured grip
Then every time I connected my camera to my computer via the USB cable provided, it claims that the USB port is not a USB 2
Camera arrived day before H
Hope this little bit of information will save money for anyone else who preordered
I love this camera.
for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
spec looked great until i took pictures, very poor at best, my 10 year old nikon d50 takes better pictures, the video has lines all over it and breaks down in many areas, overall build quality was totally cheap, spend the extra few bucks and get a canon t3 or nikon 3100 both work great, i actually bought a used nikon d5100 from amazon because i already had lenses which helped keep the price down, i don't know about mirror less tech but the live view on the canon and nikon works great, as many have noted the viewfinder and lcd on the sony are useless- love sony products , this does not live up to their reputation
I did not like this camera very much
Love it
That's why I took it back
This bridge camera is not 'cheap' in any way except maybe for the price when factoring in the value it provides but, as a bridge, it may underwhelm those who have used DSLRs for years while 'point and shoot' users may find it too big, too complicated and probably too expensive
If I never see it again, I won't be disappointed
Garbage
The camera itself is about as good as my cell phone and the colors look a little off
My brother can use my Nikon Coolpix L830 and even likes it but he struggles like a gaint trying to change the a new borns diaper
I highly recommend this camera if you are looking for a point & shoot that takes fantastic pictures, and has pretty good video capabilities with a good zoom, and is well built that will fit in your pocket
You can have it up, running and zoomed in all the way in just about a second
No optical view finder; pictures must be framed via LCD monitor, which is extremely difficult in daylight with sun behind you
I think this camera's options will satisfy most users
It doesn't even give you a numerical percentage anywhere
I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
Great point and shoot
Excellent
So all in all I am very pleased
My only disappointment so far is that you cannot shoot super fine quality in the &#34;auto&#34; shooting function
I recommend it for someone wanting a simple to use camera, great pics, low light, 10x zoom and stereo 1080p video
Of course, packing more megapixels into the same sensor size causes less light to be collected by each pixel, but on the other hand, Canon stated this new one is a "High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor" and also a new noise-reduction algorithm works more effectively, so such a resolution leap should not cause any noticeable deterioration in IQ
i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
I really like the camera, the zoom is great takes great pics
This is a great camera for the nostalgic types out there that like the esthetics of the vintage feel of the modern spin on the old Polaroid cameras
I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
Flash and battery door pop up seems flimsy and I felt it won't last very many use or break off on slight mishandling
I also liked the zoom lens - it works well
I've tried put jpg images taken by an iphone into the SD card, but it can not read the pictures and shows "file error"
if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
It was recommended by a friend for the type of photographer that I am and it is exactly as described
I really honestly don't see how anybody with larger hands could find the SL1 comfortable to shoot with given its very shallow grip
s8100
The only negative is the video capture is a proprietary Panasonic file type and you have to buy the conversion software separately to make your DVD's - but, that's not a huge deal considering how well the camera does both photos and video - awesome
Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.
100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
Knowledge of a camera's PASM settings will help a great deal here as you can really break through the surface features if this camera and get a lot out of it
A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
The panorama modes are wonderful.
This is a great camera for users who want to use long focal length for wildlife and don't want to spend money for a huge, heavy and expensive DSLR lens
7 picture quality is excellent .
the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
It did produce good quality photos
unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
At the time of this writing, Amazon is still offering the Sony E 55-210mm F4
They are selling this camera at such a lower price only because they want their customers to invest in their great lenses later
So you MUST know the menu to be able to really get the most out of the A3000
I've never seem a camera shoot so well in Auto
Although the ability for the camera to take a picture based on the introduction of a face, a face smiling or winking is pretty slick
The photo's are cloudy and hazed and you don't get a really good image
Absolutely
(always keep an extra set
I was impressed with the functionality of the camera
I love how the pictures look :D and its so thing and light to carry around :) Im happy with my purchased
Great little camera
The dual controls for the telephoto are nicely placed and quite accessible
I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
] An example of it at its best is the Oregon Coast pictures at [
1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 " or 5x7 " prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 " photos once in a while .
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
Before leaving, I had some trouble with the lens cover closing, probably because of dirt
i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
Example is in the AI mode I was using the zoom to take a close up and the symbol on the screen changed to the little flower which on my old FZ7 would have been a setting for taking close-ups of things like flowers
I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do.
I have put back in the camera level tested again but it looks like I will be buying a new card
We went camping this weekend and I took a picture of the moon
i do know the zoom lens is very good
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
Perfect Balance of Zoom and Quality
So, why the strong rating for a point and shoot Nikon?1
I have been using a Canon EOS 7
The software that comes with it is impressive
This camera fits perfectly between my Rebel XT DSLR, which takes excellent pictures but is bulky (especially with all the lenses) and a small and light ELPH 100HS point and shoot
The loss of one custom button makes this worse
I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
The functions are good, but the body feels cheap because it is
Such a nice camera for a cheap price
i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
I've taken it to a couple parties where it does just fine snapping pictures and the ability to print on the spot and hand over the picture is a nice throwback to the old poloroid days
The continuous auto-focus while recording an HD video is a highly useful feature when the subject is a constantly moving 14 months kid
This kinda feels like a toy, but what cool, fun gadget isn't
No, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.
FYI: I've read reviews that some were able to pseudo-compensate via manual controls, but when the moment is there, you want to capture it quick
I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
I could hear it during the process
The placement is very awkward
i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
I don't think they are even in the same class so maybe this isn't a fair criticism
I used ISO speed from 100 to 3200 to get an idea of how well the noise reduction worked on each camera without sacrificing image quality,RESULTS: The best camera from ISO 100 to 1600 - Sony A3000
Check DPReview's site for a great comparison tool
My husband needed a camera that corrected for shake, and so far, this one is impressive
;)
Pictures excellent
Last month my 2 year old t3 stopped working and displayed an error 20 on the screen
Things like the tilt screen,,,the external MIC plug, the macro setting on the setting wheel is gone, and now must be found in the setting menu (it's easy to find, but it used to be easier to just turn the setting wheel)
comparison between L830 and predecesor L820
Good photo quality, nice zoom
this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
the grain was terrible .
It is sleek & easy to use
The EVF on the A3000 is small and dark
The pictures were very comparable to my Nikon Coolpix 500
that picture alone made the camera worth it
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
While it lasted, it was a great little camera
A great buy
The photo editing software that is included with it is also outstanding
Basic features are intuitive and easily within reach
I have just started using it and so far, it is very user friendly
I have an FZ200 and am very pleased with it so far
The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
I wish I could give this product five stars
COOLPIX L830
I have ac delco batts in the camera now
at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
Five Stars
Hopefully they fix that with updated firmware
I've posted several photos at this Amazon camera link for people to view that demonstrate the features most important to me
Very good when you travel and easy to use
just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
I haven't had the camera for a very long so I am still learning about it, but the camera is easy to use and takes great pictures, which is what I bought the camera for
I like that it automatically goes to or from facial reconition to macro, etc
I love the fact you can tilt the screen
Since I don't like using a flash, it's not a big downside, but I do want to point out that this camera really lags behind in this area
Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
The pictures it takes are beautiful
This is the best camera I have ever owned
It is a product that meets specifications if Information
The first camera I received drained a fully charged battery after 4 photos and would not take video, it just shut off and said change the batteries
as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
Otherwise the size, controls and handling of the camera were fine
10X zoom is wonderful
I totally love the screen versatility
I often find that my fingers confuse the issue without my intention or permission
The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
I was almost expecting it to be twice the size that it is, but that's alright because its now that much easier to carry without unwanted bulk
Out of 337 332 were good
5mm LCD panel on the rear of the camera
It takes "OK" photos- good but the color and focus never seems quite correct, especially when taking pictures that require a long depth of field
i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
Received 5/4/11 & returned 5/5/11
On the other hand, when trying to take a still of the sunset
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
One of the nicest features on this A3000 camera is that in manual mode, the EVF or LCD will show you EXACTLY what the the image will look like
Cons:- Battery life
a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
Great in dark places and long distances
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
The thing that drives me crazy is that i can't contact the seller so i can request return
Hope the zoom is good
Easy to operate and hold
Compact and light enough to cart around when space is on budget
It can take brilliant photo and video, well beyond my expectations
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
I wanted a camera that was easy to use - no swapping out lenses or tricky settings
In 2011, I returned for a 45 day trip
It's just an amazing deal to get so much
It's a great idea for fun with your kids
Camera is a paper weight.
Great Camera
SOLD
Also seems to have issues focusing sometimes at the end of the zoom
There is a T5 and a T5i and it's not easy to tell what the differences are
the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
Definitely weighs more than my ultracompact, but I knew that going into this class of camera
I like the WiFi remote control in this camera
On the cruise I was less worried about packing light and cords and such so I brought both cameras and chose depending on the situation (Nikon at night, Canon on most excursions)
great tool
I was thrilled to get the increased zoom and mega pixels when the FZ 40 arrived, and the image quality continued to be outstanding, although fewer images were keepers which I attributed to the difficulty of controlling hand-shake at the larger zoom factor
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
Nearly perfect
To get more detailed instructions I'm going to try the Nikon website
Bought it for before/after pics for my refinishing biz, does the job
Don't use alkaline batteries
Great videos
Overall, it's a good camera and takes good quality pictures
It is light and easy to hold with one hand
Coolpix S8100 camera
It seems kind of flimsy and probably will not last
The touch screen/screen resolution made it nice experience
So you end up with a camera that loses out on compactness but doesn't have any of the advantages of an actual DSLR or typical mirrorless system
I must say that the performance is really excellent, especially for the price point
And the Lumix has the ability to adjust photos in the camera, which is pretty cool and which we are all getting used to on our smartphones
Fortunately the product works and our niece was okay with it having been opened, however we are sorely disappointed that Amazon lacks quality control even with third party dealers
I put it up on FB and received many kudos for the shot
You can still look at the files through the computer, but trying to move them or view the images results in windows explorer (Not internet explorer) to crash, causing you to be stuck on your desktop
Or sticking with the Sony NEX range of mirrorless systems (or any of the other excellent brands with similar cameras) which have the advantage of being much more compact and easy to carry around
I bought this camera at amazon
Boy was I wrong
The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
I used this for my trip to Spain and Italy
I am not a good photographer
Easy to use with fabulous features of blink detection that makes ready everyone with open eyes
This is not a small camera - has look and feel of a good SLR at a much more reasonable price point
(Digital single lens reflex--a camera you can change lenses to add a telephoto or a wide angle lens like the pros do
i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
For both the priority modes, the additional adjustments are then made via a control wheel on the rear of the camera body
The Nikon S8100 should come with a written operator's manual rather than a software C/D that has to be viewed on a computer screen
- MANUAL FLASH SELECTION: Not only must you pop up the flash manually, but it's a tiny, inconvenient switch on the side where your hand will never naturally land
I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
I have never had a Coolpix before, so I'm in the early learning stages with it
it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
Low light performance was particularly dissapointing, and white balance was very eratic
Easy to use and color image is fantastic
The form factor is nice, great for keeping the camera steady on the go
So the camera becomes unavailable during that time
First let me say that I was impressed by all of the features listed
photos had some artifacts and noise .
The 10x zoom is very good although I would like to have seen from a 12 to 15, but then the picture quality may have suffered
the software you get with this camera is perfect .
It even has built in tops to help you take great pictures
did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
I love this camera and it will be part of my birding equipment from now on
Again I only used it for 3 days, so perhaps these features were overlooked, but at the least I can say that finding them was unintuitive for me
I got the "Battery Exhausted" message with the batteries it came with so in my excitement, I ran to Target to buy 2 packs of Energizer Lithium batteries, a case and a memory card
This camera did not stand up to good quality photos
rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
and that's been for at least 25 years
Again, it exists as a second camera
- Picture quality is decent
I am not very techie  so I am still trying to figure out some things
I like to hook the camera to a TV to set up various parameters and see the live results as I make changes
I am older and cannot use anything complicated and I find that this meets all my needs and is easy to understand
Colors are good and images are SHARP
Auto settings work well
But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.
Love the zoom (WOW
You can get crisp, beautiful pictures in low lit restaurants without flash (provided little movements on your subjects part) free hand
The internal memory is descent with about 50 pictures worth of space
Nikon needs to get it together, not only did I waste my time, Money, but I ended up with alot of bad pictures on one of the most memorable vacation trips my mother has had
The Vivitar 1700 mAh work good but this thing eats batteries
i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
This will help capture our memorable vacation forever
The lens is very impressive, very little distortion for the money, it alone should cost as much as $300 I paid for entire set at Amazon Prime
Like I say, I got to go back to the manual
Great camera
Incredible zoom which allowed me to capture poster-worthy images of the craters on this recent Supermoon, even w/o the benefit of a tripod
I have taken handheld shots of the moon with decent results
Pros:- Did I mention it has a 60x optical zoom?- Small enough to keep with me
It's a tad pricey for what it is but, it certainly is a lot of fun
Again, you can use full auto, full manual or several combinations in between
The digital zoom is crap.
Secondly is the amazing ability to take great low light pictures
Make sure you take the lens cap off before you turn it on
You cannot buy a new camera this cheaply with all of Sony's latest technologies inside AND an APS-C sensor to boot
Super cool
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
Burst mode is fast but inside I did get a little blur between images, and it was not because of very fast action, but more when someone was moving their arm/hand
I think the focus hunting condition with mine may have just been a condition of the unit I received but I don't want to take a chance on another unit
The color is slight-moderately better & resolution much better/clearer than Sony Cyber-shot
As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
It sticks out more now and is easy to turn
We were able to take some great shots both near and far
If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
Also some of the batteries listed are not for the FZ-70
In my opinion, if you have less than $600 to spend and you want only one bridge camera, then I believe this FZ70 is made for you
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
Drawbacks are as follows1- The HD movie you take its only good for downloading to PC and can only be watched in low definitation with direct cble to TV (no HDMI or component cable included)
I find it easy to use, the pictures excellent
it is not perfect though .
For its price and features, this Lumix DMC-FZ70 is hard to beat
3 OSS Lens for $200
It takes fantastic indoor pics
I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
The photo quality is excellent
The film has poured out so many times its annoying messy and completely inconvenient
Strange noise from the lens
Very fast and great zoom
I suppose this camera works well for some, but I can't offer any more than a tepid recommendation that it does work
Great little camera
Perhaps because of higher pixel density? From ISO 800-12000 the darker areas in images have way too much noise and you will see a lot of hot pixels, even at faster shutter speeds
It's also quick to turn on and shoot the first shots
This is a GREAT hybrid camera for the price
Way faster than either of my Panasonic Lumix cameras
If I won't cary it around, I won't use it, and if I won't use it, what's the point?
Great Camera for the dollar
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
At this price point, you can't go wrong
And, with 3 kids - this is important because I waste a lot of shots
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
The zoom is phenomenal especially if you set the camera to 7MP and put it on a tripod
I like to carry a camera with me at all times and this one was perfect
Great Camera For the Money
It's basic design and straight-forward operation make it a great choice for students or someone who wants something that can give them better image quality than their phone or point and shoot
Nikon Camera
Not bad for instant crafting
Great telescoping lense, big viewing screen, compensates beautifully for movement and has easy to understand settings
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
a few things that might make it even better :
Super photos on a recent trip
I have returned it and am now on the hunt again for a new camera
First, i realized that your finger gets in the way when you hold the camera, so your flash wont pop up
Can't download photos into android tablet
My complaints are that the menu system is not very organized, the print quality is not what was expected (based on type of paper too) and there is no way to reverse printing
Great camera
The pictures are awesome, and I would not have had it fixed for that price except, if the USB/AV port is bad, you cannot upload photos OR charge the battery
It takes great pictures and I love the 30x optical zoom
I'm not a professional but it sure feels close to being one for me
The best camera, of course, is the one you have with you
and not a lot of extra's are needed to make this an amazing tool
Although the G3 had very, very good image quality and even great video (in good light), a m4/3 or DSLR is an investment item
I'm keeping it since it serves the purpose and I figured if I really want a good quality print, I can just print it from the store
It felt a little like finding the needle in the haystack
Now this is a camera
Love this camera
Nothing Special
Good camera, recommend
I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
It took beautiful photos when I was out west in Wyoming
I'm sure I haven't taken it through all of it's bells and whistles, but so far, I'm very pleased with the purchase
My only grip is that taking panoramic shots requires software to piece the images together later (image names for panoramic shots get names )
i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
Problems solved
We have already tried the camera out, and it truly is an amazing camera with clear photos
For a non-professional it's ideal
Great for getting a quick series shot, instead of a burst of shots (good for getting a single shot of a quick moment)
Image quality is top notch for a point and shoot
The video resolution on the T5 is better than the T3 and there is an auto-contrast detection
Nice camera
 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
In fact there was a topless sunbather in one that I hadn't seen and my son was delighted that I got such a sharp, focused shot
Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
There is also to many settings and it is difficult to figure out the best one, if I want to try different settings, the subject has moved or the light is different by the time I scroll to the next one, that said, I do like everything so far and will continue to experiment with all the settings
looks nice, works OK
But overall it's fast and dependable
I'll start with what the camera does well: it does fit in the small hip pocket of my backpack, which was a prerequisite as this was to be my camera for long-distance backpacking trips
Best all purpose camera with an affordable price
I just don't know how much more research I could have done
But these positives don't even come close to outweighing the horrible quality of the printouts
I wanted a camera I could be comfortable with, not spend too much time setting up my shots, and still get a great picture in the end
all metal, but light enough and sized right to slip into a shirt pocket
The power button on top can easily be accidentally toggled as well
Camera looks nice  and the  zoom is  very nice
Pictures in a sunny day the images were nice, but a bit soft
Opening it is not too difficult, but the closing mechanism is a little awkward
Same with the gutters on a neighbor's house, and the dashboard of a small airplane
The price was much lower than the retail stores
You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
I had purchased rechargeables, and they lasted the rest of the two weeks in France, with power to spare
Zoom is awesome, shoots well in low light and movies are good for close-range
Nothing was done to it and it was sitting on a shelf
I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
Five Stars
Better than their previous version
Lots of cool settings, far zoom, amazing quality videos and pictures
Takes excellent pictures and movies
More detail. More natural color.
The low light capability is excellent and beyond what I was expecting
After a few uses, you'll figure out exactly where you need to place our index finger so it does not infer with the flash
Very user friendly
the included memory card is too small .
So, now I have put out an additional $104 for them to correct the problem (that they are saying is impact damage, yet it has never had any impact)
Zoom range is one thing, the stabilization is good too
It is interesting that there are so many negative reviews on this product - but in looking at them most of them are related to the video quality, not still image which is uniformly rated 5, or in only some cases a 4
Something I have discovered that I do like
I don't own a lot of compact cameras
The tilt screen is great, it allows this senior to get shots that would be difficult otherwise
A good, good, good (bridge) camera
Video is captured by pressing a prominent "Movie" button adjacent to the viewfinder
It also came with charges for any country you may be using it in
Having said all that, if you compare this camera to others in its price range, it does do a nice job overall
But once you start printing straight off of the camera it is such a rush you're actually amazed it is so compact
making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
Love this little camera
Glad I made this purchase
1 MP where?
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
On a scale of 1 to 10,  I would give Amazon a 10 and the Nikon S8100 about a 3
Maybe
Also I noticed no zoom motor noise while watching the video
So far this is worth every penny we spent on it
Been taking pictures for over 30 years and needed to upgrade
My Sony HX1 was much fasterBody is a little too large (but this is a personally preference)Custom buttons have been reduced
Bottom line is that this camera takes exceptional pictures, but as far as its overall performance, it is trying to fill a very awkward nitch in my mind
1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
The only drawback is the EVF really lacks clarity
with fabulous features
Unit arrived overnight which was nice
Nikon s8100
I took many good pictures -  sharp and clean, with nice colors
i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
i am very pleased with it so far .
We were immediately taking awesome photos of our pets up close, and distant birds and squirrels out in the yard on full 60X zoom, with nice bokeh effect and great color and quality
Sometimes if you just point-and-shoot in auto mode, and take a flash photo, the result can be pretty awful
Best Camera I Ever Had
Very bad for video
If you're looking for a good case, the Case Logic QBP-202 is a perfect fit (still allows you to store a small cable and some SD cards if needed)
Battery life was good, and picture quality was great
Shooting in a variety of lighting conditions and distances, I found a very neutral rendering of most colors
I have yet to swap in the 1700 mAh spares I purchased, but hope they add a few exposures to what the supplied battery can provide
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
It's a great step up from you basic point and shoot and from the L820 that we had purchased earlier
The manual focus control isn't nearly as good or as quick as a ring, but will get the job done if your subject will stay still
Feature packed lightweight camera
hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
I put in an unused card I had in my desk drawer and it worked after some fiddling in the menu
I wanted a digital point and shoot that I could use in the place of my bulky Canon SLR
i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
It's not suitable for action photography, but for all other kinds of photographic situations, it's certainly up to the task
You may not need a tele- lens though, since the digital zoom is exceptional and sensor is huge
but I am carrying around the bulk and weight of a 60X zoom, and not being able to use that full range effectively
I can live with that
i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
The internal memory seems to be defective which makes it go wacky
So fast that I found it a bit hard to get the zoom just right at first
Again, I don't mind relying on auto and scene modes on a point and shoot but those modes have to do at least a decent job of interpreting the scene
they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
as of now I'll never go back
my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
The stabilizer isn't very good at damping out motion from walking, but it's fine for stabilizing shots while you're standing still
Unfortunately, the camera lacks some key capabilities for a camera in it's price range:No auto focus - the 3 zone focus switch found on less expensive Polaroid instant cameras should have been replaced by full auto focus
I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
I have noticed fewer problems after shooting with the camera for several days, but remain leery
this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
Other things:(a) contrary to the good impression many reviewers have of the Sony 18-55, I found the lens to severely lack in sharpness, especially at the borders;(b) the sensor is very nice, but a bit noisier than my 16mp Pentax K-30;(c) the camera comes with a small brochure, but you'll have to download the more comprehensive handbook from Sony's website;(d) no charger, either--you can charge the camera directly or buy a charger;(e) I found the menu fairly difficult to navigate
And our prints had really bad streaks
Everything else is pretty standard
The location makes for awkward shooting (its right where everyone would hold the camera)
Cameras worked fine but you had to hold the battery door shut
There is a small pad for your thumb, but its placement just felt unnatural
While disappointed, I guess I have no one to blame but myself
In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
Returned it to Amazon and got a replacement
Overall, very satisfied with this camera, would not have been able to get the awesome pics of the animals without the zoom
This camera simply works for me
In lower light it was totally useless
that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
My "disappointment" is due to the fact that this model DOES NOT HAVE A LEICA LENS
Zoomed in to take a  nice still picture,  and the deer looks like it was standing right in front of her
Although, if Nikon decides to add a night vision capability to this camera, sign me up
It has a lengthy instruction book and will take time to master its various intricacies
However, it does not have rechargable batteries which is a big must for me
The 'intelligent Auto' setting is just amazing and the autofocus is very customizable and very fast
If u can get this kit cheap, or camera, like for $170, then yeah u have yourself a deal
if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
The Microsoft SURFACE tablet and this Polaroid camera
You have to physically spread the lens covers apart until they stay apart
Error message of "this card cannot be read"
As a filmmaker, the video option is great to mess around with and, when viewed on a PC, are great quality
A+ and I am telling everyone who wants a nice compact camera to shoot almost anything for a reasonable price
It takes pictures that are worthy of being taken and printed
I wish I could have gotten both at the same time
Great value, rare 20mm wide angle plus super 60x zoom
), I had to limp by for a few days recording everything to the internal memory, which surprisingly was doing quite well keeping up with my ultra happy shutter finger
Here are the features I really like about the Sony a3000
touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
It's not in the supposed condition
The instructions are easy
I am hoping to experiment more and get some very good results from this camera, INDOOR and outdoor
It is hot enough to be annoying.
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
) The touch screen makes manual settings a breeze
It is a larger camera (not pocket) size
On one hand, when my S8100 worked it was a nice camera
Great Camera
Delighted
Very good camera for casual shooting
i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
But can't seem to pick it up without pushing one of them silly bottoms
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
I've also played with the Continuous and timer modes to get some amazing full moon pictures
Imagine at some point soon, it will end up belonging to one of my daughters
)I DON'T LIKE SO MUCH:- No external battery charger (one is available as an option, or aftermarket ) -- This is a Sony design choice on all their cameras- The resolution on the screen and the EVF is a little low- The shooting speed is limited- The selection of Sony E-mount lenses is still limited (and they are pricier than equivalent DSLR lenses)THE BOTTOM LINE:The A3000 is a great choice for a compact camera user who is on a tight budget, ready to move up to a fully controllable camera with interchangeable lenses also capable of shooting quality HD video, while retaining a simple user interface and powerful automatic mode
It is a nice product in it's category, wide angle to super tele in one lens
I'm finding this to be quite untrue, and it is unlike every camera I have used in the past
I wanted a DSLR, but didn't have the money for one
I have not taken many videos yet, but it looks nice so far
Image quality is superb and one will love it
there is zero stability control so you have to have very steady hands
I love the micro zoom which allows me to take excellent detailed pictures of flowers and any small item
The Panasonic pictures are awesome, it's easy to use and has some great editing features
Images in low light are very difficult to accomplish and the flash doesn't help with the results (muddy, grainy prints
I will make sure and purchase a screen protector for the LCD
The action shots when the sun was still up turned out great and I was at the tip top of the bleachers still getting closer shots then my old 24zoom
I haven't tried editing videos as yet, so I cannot comment on that, but so far so good
This $350 camera w/lens is a giant killer when it comes to image quality
The main adjustment to make is in the resolution, the default is 1080, I moved it to 1080*
Making sure there is sufficient inter-shot overlaps and the perspective distortion of the overlapping areas
This is much smaller than sensors in APS-C or Micro Four-Thirds cameras
Also, the auto mode really doesn't handle the flash gracefully--you need to fidget with things to get sharp photos
Good video too and much moreFor the beginner
i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
It took unbelievable pictures and the size is perfect to put in your pocket
Cell phone take better pictures
Shot a small video also and used the zoom quite a bit to see how the stabilization worked
I got it now though
I then realized a major design flaw.
Also, with the zoom extended to the max, sometimes it takes a little time for lens to focus sharply on the object, playing with the settings for the focus area helps
The camera starts up fast and is quick from shot to shot
All about the zoom, baby
I know I've still yet to explore everything my Sony has to offer but I'm so proud to share the pix I've been taking with it pretty much right out of the box
Bought it for my daughter's graduation; she loves it
Once on the proper setting it does take a great photo but I'm not sure I want to be so committed to the thing as to have to take a college level course to learn how to use it
The video itself is fantastic and crisp with smooth playback
I was very happy with this purchase
This one is perfect
but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
I love this little camera
I have lost more than a few shots fumbling to get the darn thing open
If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
This camera is working like a charm
I love the zoom
Really love it
Long story short - I am supremely happy that I bought this camera
So hard to find the perfect camera, but am real happy with this one
Because it is light, compact, yields quality results and is not expensive I am likely to pack it on every trip
When It Works, it's great
Do you hear me Sony
I love the ease of use and the light weight
but I would rather have it be noisy and fast, just to have access
What is the difference between this expensive Nikon and $5 Kodak digitial
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
I only use the basic, camera-figures-out-everything setting
It has many extras on it that I almost wished that I would have ordered one for my other son as well
Here's a tip though
the photos looks very natural
bigger image sensor3
Besides the normal family pictures I take lots of pictures of my kids playing basketball, football and soccer
The quality of the pictures is so much better and the versatility of this camera is amazing
But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
It  has  a very fast processor,  long optical zoom
As you read the ones here it is easy to see the rookies, whining about everything
The start up time on this is amazing
Cons:Pano mode, while it works great, does not have a manual exposure control
As  I previous said it fits my hand well
It doesn't provide as detailed a view as some of the higher resolution screens on the T5i and 70d but it is equally viewable in direct sunlight
3) High video resolution
It comes with a rechargeable lithium battery pack
And the zoom is incredible
nice quality
It is a digital point and shoot that prints but has some limitations
Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
I have been using my new camera to photograph action scenes of my new invention, The FlashBak Rear bike light
We took only 3 shots, and the streaks just got worse
You get the same 18-55 IS II lens that came with the T3
I added a couple of photos of my cat and golden retriever taken in the continuous mode (12MP*)
I’ve even linked it to my iPhone5 over Wi-Fi and like the ability to transfer pictures so that I can post some immediately on Flickr or Facebook
The zoom is great, the pictures are awesome
Well the video was better than my dedicated Panasonic HD camcorder
Real Disappointment
Flexible enough for most situations, large and luminous screen
Its a cute little camara and I would totally recommend this for anyone who wants that old polaroid feel
I purchased this camera to take with me on a trip to Africa
First, I must state that I have NOT purchased this camera
I am very pleased with the upgrades from my SX300HS
Having a nice case is key too
The wheel on the back of the FZ70 is a huge improvement over the one on the FZ150
The photo quality is amazing.
What I didn't like about it is that it feels cheap and made of plastic material but Nikon may have done it to make it light in the weight
Would you give up your Canon SX50 for the FZ70?
we are very disappointed
The t5 seemed to be the right fit for me, more megapixels along with tried and true technology
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
I have see impressive pictures of this camera but also some who are not as detailed as of the Ixus SD500.
Video clips don't always load to my media player
) I also like the separate video button, rather than having to select "video" on the dial then press record
I liked the weight of the camera and easy to carry with me
Not What I Expected
easy navigate menu8
Lens Error Strikes Again
Everytime you would take pictures of somebody wearing white, there would be a white glow shining in the picture
You cannot go wrong with a Nikon
the A37 operates the same way
It seems I spent a good deal of money for a part-time camera
my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
The image is perfectly fine for travel and family
jpg format), unfortunately when shooting against a dslr  with this in
The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys nature and has a moderate budget
The camera comes with everything you need to get started, and includes a very helpful handbook with illustrations and all you need to know about this product
Very handy if you like how a picture turned out and want to try to repeat the results
They are so fast, and virtually no waiting
I highly recommend this product (my mom and my sister both bought one)
have seen and used various brands/styles, film (slides and prints, different kinds of films) and digital
(2) holding the camera still enough for low light photos at long telephoto settings was a problem
Still learning some things
I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
I has a very easy to sue Panorama option
my wife loves her camera - the pictures are of high quality and it was easy to use
big lcd screen - at least for me, 2" is enough
It totally delivers
This is an amazing piece of technology for the price
Both have the same sensor so they both perform about the same image-quality wise
i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
When I was initially looking for a camera I thought that picture quality was my number one priority, however picture quality aint worth nothin if you leave the camera at home.
save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
I went to New Mexico for New Year's
Highly recommend this camera to anyone that wants a little extra with their camera
I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
Between this and my LX7 I am set for awhile with cameras
With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.
The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
either bad lighting, too grainy, and the biggest problem, terrible color balance
Fantastic camera, I have wanted to buy this camera for some time (my son has one), finally it came down to my price range
If you want a very light camera, with more battery life and to save some money, the T5 is excellent
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
Obviously this only works up to a point
) But that benefit is completely eliminated by the fact that the pictures are blurry
Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
Unlike a DSLR (or SLR) there is no mirror system to provide true TTL image viewing
Bought this camera for my boyfriend and he was so excited when he opened the box but it is true that the battery does not last long and the worst part of it is that the print quality is terrible
We got the S8100, and she now gets amazing videos, with which we both are pleased
2- Lighting is not automatically set and after you take the picture you will find out if the brightness needs to be adjusted
It takes great pictures and I really like the Panasonic Menu, which is laid out well and easy to use
8 battery life is excellent .
Now, I am not a professional photographer by any means, and can't tell you any technical stuff, but this camera is AWESOME
The camera stopped focusing after 1 week
So far, so good
A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
Easy interface and quick response
I was unable to get a sharp view either with my glasses on or with them off, no matter where I rotated the diopter dial
Took this camera with me on a safari trip to Africa and I was thrilled with my pictures
Now I need to learn how to use some of the special features on it
The printed pictures are quite small and the quality is not that good
The menus could be a little more intuitive and a printed manual would have been great (it's on a disk like all other camera's these days)
I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good camera for a good price
Can't get great pics if the camera is sitting at home
I bought it for my wife as a gift,and she likes it so it was an excellent buy
We leave for my nieces wedding in Ireland in August
1 desktop, then copying them to a thumb drive and trying to open the thumb drive in my tablet causes the photo program to instantly crash
ZOOM Wow
Picture quality has been very pleasing from macro to zoom - even on large PC monitor displayDownsides - no real negatives - I'd have liked the LCD not to be fixed but really just a quibble rather then a complaintExtremely pleased I upgraded and delighted with the camera's performance
I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
You should pay attention to the term &#34;MIRRORLESS&#34; in its description
I wasn't okay with it
The incredible zoom and the quality of the pictures makes satisfied of this choice
Great value, Awsome zoom
but it feels like a crutch
i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
I had issues with seeing the screen in bright light and it's easier for me the zero in on the subject faster with the viewfinder
(SanDisk, Toshiba, Panasonic and Lexar)
It starts up quick and is very quick between shots
It's got so many features I haven't tried them all as yet
The weight and feel of this is impressive compared to my older FZ-7
Don't expect to be impressed by the LCD on the back, either
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
I use alkaline and rechargeables and may use lithium in the future
Good items
The picture quality was above my expectations and my only complaint is; if it so happens a drink or any other object bumps the picture while it is printing it will cause some smearage or an inconvenient black spot or two
With a 2 year old, I want to capture as much as possible without having to worry about bulk and lenses
excellent idea !
No Zoom Noise whilre Recording Video, Fantastic Purchase
If you are used to automatic switching, it should not be a big deal to go to manual because the switch is within easy reach of the thumb
Fantastic so far
It wasn't hard to do, even for a non-techie
It is not very interesting to zoom 100% or check pixels for this camera (or any other camera)
Beware of battery life
Recylce time for most modes is a bit slow, but if you leave your camera on continuous mode, you can get that second shot off almost instantly, provided you don't need the flash
Cons of this camera are lighting
So if you want to spend money go ahead but don't knock this camera for minor issues
Nikon S8100
you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
The video that can be taken with this camera is amazingly good, as well as the still photos
the compliments are great but the usability and pictures are better
Would not function right out of the box
I even dropped it down a 10 foot cliff with me behind it and it worked fine after the fall
Ergonomically, this camera is comfortable to hold; the right side of the body has a protruding grip area with a textured rubber coating that aids handling (especially in cold weather)
Five Stars
Turn it off.
Took great photos using max zoom from right field with no tripod
I would recommend this product to the  non-professional who simply wants great pictures and video
now I can continue to record because it NEVER shows up
Ive read complaints about size but you get what you get for what your getting
Our son is due any day and I know she has been dying to make a scrapbook
Nikon S8100
I can most closely compare them to a $150 dollar pocket camera
I do appreciate the night pictures and the 12mp
which can give a rich almost Van Gogh effect
I've been using the predecessors to this camera (the 260SX - 280SX) and this has one of the biggest bumps in performance and quality
because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
I suggest getting in a store and test it out
Great camera from Sony
I intend to carry it in my backpack and play with it some
I also love that I do not have to use the screen and often use the viewfinder
Fun that I have not had with photography in a long time
I love it, LOVE IT
Most expensive point & shoot I have owned
-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .
The grip is deep and comfortable and makes larger, heavier lens a joy to use
Its difficult to navigate through the menus, but everything is basic enough that if you just play with it, you'll figure it out
The zoom was great, the pictures sharp and the price, very good
- When using ISO 3200(and onwards), way too many hot pixels
Truly Impressive and an Exceptional Buy
I never changed batteries for the whole week in Arizona, and then added another couple of days of battery life in France, and those were with the batteries that came with the camera
used flash as successed
it is easy to " focus " in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
Beefy enough to hold comfortably in one hand and takes great pictures easy
Unfortunately, the flash head can not be turned upward which is a shame
Love it, great camera, lots of my friends and colleagues are impressed by it
Needed one for a family member that is getting elderly and cannot work his SLR anymore
Great correspondence, prompt service
The camera's sensor is on par with a 2009 cell phone camera; granted, I didn't expect stellar images and in no way was this intended to replace my DSLR, but I had hoped that images viewed on a computer would be at least decent
It is rather very difficult to remain steady and prevent shaking as the shake of your hand also multiplies 70 times
The 60X zoom is what attracted me to the FZ70
The unit is small, compact, light, with a great picture quality
I have no regrets with this purchase
Another screen difference: the T5i swivel screen is better for video (swings out like a video camera
I don't get really good pictures with it
The quality and build of the camera is okay at best
price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
a great decision and purchase all the way around
Like it
I have had lots of bridge cameras from all makes (even the Canon SX50 which is a very good camera, but with crazy set up controls and too small), but this one beats them all taking the cost into account
If you decide to buy one of these cameras, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do
Fast to set up
Yes, you will be taking some inadvertent videos as you get used to this camera
This is the first Nikon camera I've bought - as I have owned a digital sony and cannon in the past
The battery can be used much longer than the standard AA batteries that most point and shoot cameras use
It was highly rated and true to the reviews
Only flaw is that I tend to hold the camera with my left fingers on the top of the case, but that prevents the flash from popping up
Best compact I have seen on the markte
DMC-FZ70 camera
This resulted in "red" pictures as the shutter fired while the flash, impeded by my finger, only popped up part way and so didn't actually illuminate anything
This was in bright sunlight so with less light I wouldn't expect such good results
Kinda makes sense, but just a slight inconvenience because you need to remove the lens cap first, then turn the camera back on
So, if you purchase this camera, I am sure you will be pleased with its ease of use and the exceptional quality pictures it takes
stabilization works great to reduce blur
Nice
Stabilization program very effective
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
Shooting stills in low light, the shots are amazingly clear with very little noise
the zoom for this camera is great with a high focus and you can take photos in any light conditions and the photos will still be sharp and clear , i have bought this camera to take with me on a vacation and i have made the correct choice when buying this camera
If you want manual controls look elsewhere
Nikon has an update (version 1
I think most people would not notice it
First I have to say I am not a professional photographer, but an amateur that usually likes to shoot landscapes
I had a couple of issues with this camera
Top Notch Camera
the best camera i have bought
I wouldn't drop it, and would invest in any drop and spill protection
and I don't miss not having a viewfinder
I started having fun again
JPG so it is easy to overwrite files if both cameras are being used
My fault but I will be getting another
Unfortunately I ended up sending it back
Very good camera
60x optical zoom
Great Compact Camera
The zoom is INCREDIBLE
The first time I had owned the camera less than a week
My friend bought a cheaper one and the photo prints are significantly better and without streaks
So I hold the camera in both hands, raise my hands and bend my elbows and look at the screen to line up my shot
Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
So far, so good
However, while the lower resolution sensor on the T3 tended to mask a lot of the flaws of the lens, on the T5 and its higher resolution sensor, not so much
I have never owened a better camera
I am so pumped to give this to my girlfriend for her birthday
This was annoying
I'm guessing they did this on purpose so people wouldn't realize what a battery hog this thing is
This is especially evident when zoomed to it fullest reach in anything other than bright daylight
whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
It has a wide zoom range allowing it to capture both wide views and incredible closeups of distant objects - birds and monkeys in this case
It's been over ten years since I got my last camera, my first digital one
How is it possible to build such a technological masterpiece and sell it for such a low price
Only thing I'm not to happy about it the cover for where you plug in the cord for charging
2) Much better in low light than a $100 cheaper camera I bought
So depressed but then
It works well for that and also for interior shots
i love this camera .
I think many people including me bought this camera because of its 60X zoom
Got super pictures in low light with no flash
I love that I no longer have to lug around my camera (suit)case
When it came I was petrified to start all the things I had to do to really make it mine
Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
i am not talking milliseconds .
In a nutshell, if you are intent on increasing your range & don't overly care to concern yourself w/manual settings, as well as comparing the intuitive interface, the tilting LCD screen, and most of all, the image quality to the Canon SX510 & other megazooms, I am rather confident believing there is no better camera out there anywhere at this $196 price point
Fun camera, not a fun amazon experience
I mostly use it for going out with friends and in casual settings (the occasional nature shot)
It went right back
Great camera if youre looking for a hybrid between DSLR and Compact
2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
As for the kit, Cameta ripped me off: the little tripod reeks this nasty WD40 smell I've smelt in many cheap electronics which causes headaches and nausea, STRONG nausea, the cheap secondary battery died in days, and they wouldn't give me a return shipping label
but who cares ?
The pictures were very soft (fuzzy), not good detail at full zoom
its the best ever
The image quality is amazing, and more importantly the focus time is much quicker than most cameras in this category
Since so many of the reviews mention it, I'll start by saying I don't use the video mode, I don't care about the video mode
i am quite happy with the camera .
A great camera
Love it
Now that I am home, the photo quality seems to be pretty good - at least much better than anything you can get with the cell phone
Every picture turned out clear and the zoom option was nice although I didn't need it to zoom that close
I mention the settings I have changed because it seems like people complaining about fuzzy images simply do not know how to use even a basic point and shoot camera
The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
This is a great value in a little interchangeable lens camera with a traditional style view finder
I gave the camera as a gift and though it's fairly large in size, considering it has a printer included I'd say the the size is perfect
splash !
Camera is great for nature photography, The camera has excellent Macro capabilities
It was as if the camera was constantly seeking focus
I think the Sony A3000 is the perfect camera for someone who wants:* The flexibility of interchangeable lenses* The ability to take a wide variety of picture types, from close-up to portrait to landscape, from daytime to nighttime, without giving a lot of thought to which settings need to be changed* The ability to take panoramic photos (it does a great job automatically stitching together a series of photos)* A less intimidating control panel (there are about half as many buttons and dials on the Sony than there are on my Pentax)* Something lighter and easier to carry (the Sony weighs about a half-pound less than my Pentax)Understand: this is not a DSLR
But over all I give this a definite 9/10
Secondly, I had a hard time easily finding some of the settings that I desired
Polaroid camera, an excellent fishing sinker
Tempermental camera
After quite extensive testing comparing the zooms on my FZ150 with the FZ70 I decided to return the FZ70
Tech support is rather lackluster
I bought it new, but i got the item with lots of scratches on the screen
The fact that this camera has a 20mm wide angle makes it worthy of adding to my equipment line up, I wanted something light for hiking so I bought the Canon SX280HS
Recommend buying extra battery pack and extra SD cards
I must have taken 300 pictures and at least 6 videos, I use standard Duracell batteries and never had a power shortage
Since like most people I got the camera for the still images this is a minor annoyance but still enough to keep it from being perfect
You have to tell the camera when you do this manual operation telling it that there is no lens on the camera which is an odd way of telling it to recognize the manual adapter
I probably bought the first Sony digital camera that recorded on floppy discs for $500 in 1997
I have a 5-year-old Canon that cost a third as much as this NIkon, but gives me better photos
i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
I had been searching for a new camera for some time
That's something I always look for when buying a new camera
A buying tip: If you are attracted to the latest, greatest model in a line of cameras but it's beyond the budget or has more features than you know you need, check out earlier versions of that model
The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
Better on sale
this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
Interchangeable lenses are a MAJOR reason you will want this camera
This camera has all those bells and whistles that I wanted in a camera and so easy to use
Then turn it on and press the 'menu' button
For my money, I think I can do better, so I returned this one
Feature-rich, user-friendly, and captures excellent images
In my case, I really love it
I'm having so much fun taking pictures with my new camera
Easy to use
My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
Over all, you cant complain about this little thing
The camera itself shoots much better pictures than the screen shows and prints are pretty true to color
] 1 great example of the video quality and zoom quality of wildlife
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
This A3000 camera has several in-camera HDR options
I'm just disappointed that it was hyped so much and it doesn't hold up to its name
Many bought the camera without downloading the operator's manual or checking out professional reviews first
Couldn't be happier
im not a photographer, but i think the pictures come out pretty well
So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
Have a great and easy to use bundled software
That being said - I love, love, love this camera
The only real problem I had was filling up my 32 gig card too quickly
Fantastic Purchase
The camera is responsive and is able to photograph kids at play w/o trouble
Perfect camera, feels good and sturdy, takes excellent pictures
Meaning it can stand up better to heavier lenses
It takes awesome still shots
Feels like a much lighter version of my alpha 65
So far it is doing exactly as advertised
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
It is very easy to use as well
When you have a really nice camera, I think you inherently want to learn more about the art of photography and I've signed
I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
Menu is not all that intuitive
old school
It surpasses Canon 's offering in terms of dynamic range and noise probably only topped by the 24 Megapixel sensor from Nikon/Sony/Pentax in which you have to pay a lot more money for their bodies
The Sony mentioned below has been incredible, taking great shots and creating wonderful images all in a compact package
This camera has it ALL and more
Unfortunately the video mike isn't that great, can't pick up cat purring unless right on top of camera & lots of background noise
I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
The zoom is also fantastic - image stabilization works well with this, unlike the Lumix, supposedly the best rated in this category, but in my try-out, irregular at best
if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
(5) This camera takes very, very good photos
And the more I play with it, the better it gets
Update on December 10, 2013:  After having used this camera for an extended period of time, I like it even more
this is an okay camera, but i feel that there are better out there
this does n't affect the picture , of course .
Don't know why, set it on the star 1080(default) and leave it
It had more uses than I expected
I have been playing around with several of the features on this camera but still have a lot to learn
Straight garbage i won't buy another Nikon product any time soon
i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
Another law of physics Nikon is unable to overcome, darn those guys again
Also, I think this long a telephoto really needs a much improved stabilization system, similar to Panasonic's 5-Axis stabilization
-- lousy content aside, the videos turn out great
I noted that the s830 was better rated on Amazon
for the money this is a deal
The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
My experience is you get the best results in sunny weather and indoor with flash
Plus I like using the viewfinder for stability when shooting long (bracing the camera against your face helps stabilize it)
I was surprised at the clarity of the long range shots but the true test will come when shooting action sports
If you're on a budget and want to get an interchangeable lens camera without necessarily going full DSLR, this nicely fits in your niche
With this said, I am impressed at the quality of photo from this camera
pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
It was just too much for me to tolerate
I am used to a huge professional camera, this is small compact and takes great pictures
I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
Most critics even in the magazines (ad buckets, we call them) shill for either Canon or Nikon and I ignore many of their comments
They absolutely love it
I am positive the lens wasn't bumped while it was extended so it is just an unreliable mechanism
The capabilities of this camera come across as almost too good to be true
Or if you are on vacation and wish to use it every day, just prepare ahead of time by buying a spare battery and make sure both are charged every night so that you have fresh fully-charged batteries come morning
Can't wait to get some pictures and video to see the quality and update this review
needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
I was looking for the widest (24-25 mm) with good zoom in a compact camera
1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Zoom-Nikkor ED Lens and 3
the movie mode is also working great .
BEST Digital handy
I managed a lot of shots in Africa while the SLR crowd was fumbling with lenses that cost three- to five-times (or more) what my whole camera cost
I am overall pleased with the camera and how easy it is to use
This camera is terrible under low lighting and is just overall a piece of crap
A wonderful camera
some of the great gains over g2 --
Great camera
it is larger then you think trust me but on a good note it does exactly what they said and it does it's job well
Sony's iAuto setting seems capable enough
For years, I've debated what camera to take birding
Grear
9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
The last camera I had was left in an airport in Portugal and not recovered
The focal point looks okay but anyone around it who is even moving ever so slightly, will appear blurry
from the time you press the shutter activate button to the time it focuses and the shutter goes, it's nearly 2 seconds which is eons
I just expected it to be a little better
Incredible value
No high-speed-shutter scene mode
Even when only zooming out 20x - 30x, far from the extreme limit of the camera, I didn't get one picture I bothered to keep out of well over 150 tries
BadLower light/indoor performance is poor
The "low light" option on the SCN/Scene mode only is helpful in seriously low light
I know this sony wont let me down
what a dissapointment
Full daylight, light fluffy clouds and again shooting well below the full 60x (1,200mm) zoom of the camera and the results were horrid, grainy, full of noise
Excellent camera
Great
but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
takes good pictures
I liked the Samsung touch screen a lot but I have been hearing about far too many problems with touch screen camera so this one went down the tube after a short short
This camera takes great pictures, very simple to operate
i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .
Right between the 35mm and the pocket cameras
Vacation is soon and it's going with me
Being a mirrorless DSLR, this camera does not have an optical viewfinder, which has it's upsides
Comparing this camera to the older SX280, both cameras rendered very similar (punchy) photos in good lighting
The LCD screen resolution doubled
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
I just need something that works
buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
Also I found I really missed the articulated LCD that the FZ150 has
The price seems good at first but you have to pay a thousand dollars to get the zoom that my little sony has
My more mechanical wife managed to get it closed and I left with the camera
So yeah it feels kinda cheap and the screen on the back could be much nicer but it is perfect for capturing the family around the new baby
the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
Great camera with super zoom ability
The second one I received was also defective, however since it was pass the original 14 day return policy, there was nothing I could do about it
it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
(3) OUTSTANDING low-light no-flash performance
Easy to use, great features - I recommend this camera for telephoto work without extra lenses
Second Nikon S8100 camera takes no better pictures than the Pentax Optio S45 camera that I already have
worth buying, films are cheap too
You can view your pictures without the lens being extended
Previously owned the predecesor L820 and like many say from first glance looks the same but there are multi different specs between these 2 so my review is related to their comparison
a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
In fact, it is the biggest reason behind the selection
(6) Face recognition actually works
(I could not compose properly in bright sunlight using the Nex 3)
Bought it for a trip to Alaska and the pictures turned out amazing
The lens was not as good as I expected
The backlighting feature and the night shot feature is AWESOME
the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
(6) Perhaps a bit overzealous on the noise correction
The eyepiece for the EVF is hard plastic so eyeglass wearers would find that uncomfortable and doesn't block stray lights
takes excellent photos .
I can see the screen fine, but I can also see that the camera is not being held rock steady
4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
There are numerous features and the menu system can be a little daunting, but I tend not to get carried away with all of those special scene features
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
Nice
though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
electrobrand lies, gives 0 custromer service, they just don't care
I read thru the handbook just to get the basics and it is so easy to use
00 total
I wasted $74
Happy wife,happy life
COM
Soo basically you are getting an apsc camera body for 200$
really happy with this little camera .
Although I only have had this a few weeks it is a very nice camera
Have taken several pics in last 4-5 days and besides at first not knowing much about the camera it has done a great job as I learn more about all its abilitys
I have had Panasonic Lumix models and a Casio
I bought this camera to use when I need a wide to tele travel camera
I use a DSLR full time and adding this lens in a shape of a camera, as much as there is a difference between the two, is a great way to be more mobile
Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
As kind of a hobby, and to get out of the house for a little exercise for my 78 year old frame, I go to a number of stores to shop on a daily basis, mostly 7 days per week
Bottom line, this camera captures the image I want captured; every time, in stunning quality
Really great camera
I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
great shots, zoom is great, and nice to handle
The wide angle is so sharp, it rivals my DSLR
If they worked these problems out, gave it 30 more minutes of life, and gave it an infrared or radio remote, this would be a great camera, sadly though, I can only recommend it as a great starting camera for kids, or as a high resolution backup camera with video capability
To start off I wish I was able to give it 4
- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
Perfect camera for the price
Unfortunately, the unit I received didn't focus consistently at all at the longer focal length
what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
stop on it for more depth of field
Awesome Camera
I hope they pay Ashton Kutcher alot for his advertising because thats what lead me to this camera
Good camera for the non-professional
I found the LCD to be rather low resolution and not in focus
Any person not getting what they want from this camera, is expecting WAY too much
The camera does have good zoom power but the picture quality is not what I had expected
I've had Nikons before
I also can't notice much effect using their stabilization system
also, the photo came out printed, there was no waiting for the picture to &#34;develop&#34; which is cool but isnt polaroid-ish
- OVERLY AGRESSIVE NOISE REDUCTION: I'd much rather do the retouching on my computer and be selective about how much to apply, and where
It is bigger, but a better camera and printer
How can something that cost almost 200$ have the quality of a 20$ camera? The pictures print blue
Great camera and so far I have no complaints on it at all
For the price you are paying, you are getting a lot of camera with the A3000 when compared with other competition
I am also pleased by the controls, grip, and video quality
The only reason it didn't get a 5th star is because of the camera software inside
While you'll never mistake the photos taken by this for photos from a nice dslr, for the money this camera performs really well
So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality? size[+2]
The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
Haze can actually be an issue with the long zoom, but that is true with any zoom in this range
it is basically a nex in a slr body
The strap, which is also included, helps this camera to feel nice and secure around my neck
and you have to connect it to the camera to charge battery, not take battery out
Low light photos look really good so far, but I need to experiment more
The Olympus had nice features (8x optical zoom, manual capabilities and threaded lens barrel)
The printer is ok, most of the pictures have little tiny lines over them but they were printed out of the camera so it's ok, I guess
I get a lot of complements on this camera and questions of "where can I get one?" and it got only a tiny chip when it fell four feet onto concrete
]and the scratched lens pictures, many of which were still OK, are at [
THIS CAMERA IS AMAZING
LOW LIGHTIt is not magical
From a Nikon D7000 DSLR user
I have been buying up the best cameras that still use AA batteries because; I have cerebral palsy and do not drive
Great form factor and amazing shots
Pros:-Takes amazing pictures, crystal clear even when zoomed out
i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
-I can control all the options i need to as a rookie
It comes with its own rechargeable battery
Excellent picture quality
The only thing I couldn't do was switch to black & white photos, which would have been cool in the fog
i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
I don't miss not having a viewfinder, which I thought I would
The camera would work with internal memory - but would not work with a memory card of any sort or size installed
I didn't understand, but I went in Sony store, but they, only sold me a new charger
The low light shooting is great for a point & shoot
If you aren't comfortable with say, shooting in full manual mode go with a less expensive shorter range compact zoom
Review of the Canon SX700 with comparison to the older sx280
Researched cameras before deciding to buy this one, and expected a lot
The flash is very weak.
The instructions that come with it are very basic
I'll have to say that this camera has now taken over as my favorite superzoom
Just what I was looking for
The camera body is solid/well constructed, grip is ok, a bit stingy on the left side (but I have small hands so not a deal breaker), & yes, the dial is stiff but doable
This is the camera for someone on a budget but they want bells and whistles
overall i 'm happy with my toy .
Better than their previous version, I like the ease it takes to take pictures and how the auto focus works, you will too, takes great pictures
This is a very good camera in all respects, and great value for the money
Bottom line, manufactures are missing the boat by not having more options with optic viewfinders  in their comoact models
No suggestions for improvement
As someone who normally goes straight to Canon, I am surprised by how strongly I am recommending it
Best camera I have owned in a decade
Bottom line is you will not be discouraged with this purchase
from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
You'll carry it with you every day.
Because there are not many external controls, you have to go through menus to access settings
Wide angle is 20 mm and it zooms out to 1200mm at full extension
This provides a modest HDA exposure that doesn't scream "manipulation" and also, I believe, provides some sharpening
use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
great camera for the price
Nice
digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
Great camera--great price
(1) my eyesight makes it difficult to manage
and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
That being said, they do last a long time but be sure to keep some spares
I've taken several videos with it and it was simple to do
It was time to upgrade our Canon 5MP camera so after reading a whole lot of reviews, I chose this one
I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
For the price, you can't beat it
The resolution of the screen and low light pictures are terrible
I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
4) BIGGEST COMPLAINT BY FAR:  Although the camera takes great pictures in in dimly lit rooms in terms of visibility (awesome nightshot of an old town street in exas - looks like it was still dusk), but the camera is a horrific disaster when it comes to clarity
It's not the best build quality (it's not bad, however) but, BUT, the image quality is much better than the NEX-6
Now the Amazon guarantee is not in effect, and when returned to Nikon, they replied that this is not covered under their guarantee (surely, because this problem happens so often to their cameras that it wouldn't be worth it)
30x Optical Zoom Works Great, the best compact camera with zoom
I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.
The camera was larger than expected, But once I started using the different options I was amazed by the quality of the pictures and ease of use
You also have access to your photos digitally as well which is not the case with other point-shoot-print cameras
Hard to move and feels like it will break easily
We did not want to jump into the DSLR arena, but wanted to get shots as-close-as-possible
But being well within my price range, I couldn't resist buying it
The FZ200, however, costs $150 more than the FZ70, and it has its own weaknesses
This review is based solely on my experience with the camera
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
Side by side comparisons with lesser cameras bring out the start difference in color clarity and definition
Mediocre Image Quality
I am ever so pleased with this purchase and the photo quality is AMAZING
This camera is very easy to use and takes high quality photos
But it isn't any different, despite the increase in pixels
Again, this is perfect for travel or family use
easy to use
but remember you need the right amount of light to get the Best quality out of the Pictures and Video
My friend enjoys the shake reduction which saves her quite a few pictures
Perhaps I just need to go online and find more detailed descriptions
Big Zoom but Poor Image Quality UPDATED
So this new Canon camera is a very good compact device for taking nice still pictures and advanced video recording
at various events and be able to print them right then & there without any editing
I love how easily I can switch from stills to movie mode
added 2-24 .
It has a good optic, nice 10x zoom, very sharp and detailed LCD, VR, wide angle lens and a perfect look
Not sure this is the camera for me,
But because there is no viewfinder, it is difficult to take pictures, as it is very hard to keep it still, especially with the zoom
Awesome zoom
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
Print outs do not come out clear
I love it and am sure the more time I spend learning all its features, the more satisfied I will be
The EVF is full of noise and is tough to see when you are in focus, but the focus peaking feature really helps me judge when I'm sharp
WOW! Big difference!
It's a wonderful concept in the sense that you can print whichever pictures you want without wasting film like other polaroids and save them
0-Inch LCD (Black)I had considered a DSLR, but thought that this model would probably do almost anything I wanted
Aside from that it is definitely worth the money
it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
The image quality is superb
Does not meet the hype, Aviod it completely
i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .
My wife and I each have carried our own 300HS for about two years
The zoom is great, very simple option menu, great portability, come with a manual
The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
second one i bought
Well wait no more!
Get one today
forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
in manual , you can set it to " single af " where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
On the other hand I am completely in love with the camera, it's cute and has good quality :-D
I think it's a great camera for someone who knows the basic of a camera
The flash is the downside to this camera
Great Price for Quality Camera
i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
Viewfinder image very crisp
I am very happy with my purchase
Unfortunately this camera seriously lacks in one major category that is important to certain people
Bought the printer at the same time, but having difficulty finding a compatible cord for my Android phone or computer, so have not clue if it works yet
really?I can't believe a camera released in 2014 wouldn't come with an orientation sensor, but if you take a lot of pictures, this is a deal-breaker
Camera began to scroll, erratically, at about day 100
Love the 34x zoom, was like I was standing right next to my subject from across the auditiorium
i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
the camera has a wonderful set of features .
I LOVE the Nikon Coolpix L830
The viewfinder picture is a bit less clear than I would like and somewhat small but manageable
The camera is stylish and comfortable to use
Way below expectation
Bought this for my wife and the 60X zoom is fantastic
again all in-camera
Yes, it is a fake DSLR
Great Features but flash pictures are HORRIBLE
Favorable reviews insist on the excellent price of this camera
The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
I haven't dropped or mistreated the cameras, as far as I know
I spent a month looking at cameras, Nikon, Canon, Samsung and more, but after reading all the reviews and being completely confused, selected the L830 and am happy I did
It also provides lots of shooting modes
all this cammera can do
Again, this is not simply a "point and shoot" camera, although much of the time you get excellent results just using the iA Mode (and altering nothing else)
i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
Design choice of rechargeable battery pack rather than 2 AA lithium ion batteries; pack can not deliver full day of pictures; for whole day, one needs at least one extra battery pack, at $60 each
This camera is a must-have for long-distance zoom power, ease of use, and quality of pictures
this camera has a major design flaw .
Even in full sun there was significant blur
Indoors it forced me to use ISO2000 which leads me to the next con, poor image quality in low light
Video quality is also very good
Inexpensive enough to be great gift for young people
i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
Our first good camera
Excellent camera
following my research , i decided on the g3 .
in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
easy to handle and carry either around you neck or in a sm  camera bag
so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
I received this camera as gift in December
Being able to see real time your adjustments taking place is just great
I was replacing my Canon SD1000, which I loved
I would like to say a little more about the image stabilization
once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
After several hours of use, the flickering seemed to mostly go away, but not entirely
However, a T2 is a lot cheaper and works better
The photos print with a green/blue hue
Hope this helps thanks for reading this wall of text
If you can pick up this kit from Amazon for under $300, and your priority is image quality, then don't hesitate
It is like a little magnet gadget and has a tiny cord that holds the cap while it is off the lens
Here's my experience with it for the past year:The bad:-about 1/10 pictures in lower light areas would come out COMPLETELY whitewashed, no matter the setting I used-it was really difficult to focus it on up close things-it took forever to focus-I'm now getting lens error readings (and, like I said, I've had it for only a year)-it randomly deleted my graduation photos
I read that in other reviews but thought it would be worth it if I was careful
The only near negative is that the view screen is hard to see in bright sun while doing video
I have been having my T2 for some years now for sports photography
While I wish there was an manual button on the lens mount to switch from manual to auto focus modes, the electronic, menu-driven option for this (along with the flash mode) is available in the top-most level of menu options
High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
*******As an update nine months later
One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
Stored in a padded case.
Soooo tired was I of the washed out deer-in-the-headlights effect of the Canon - finally, I take a picture of my dog, and it looks like my dog, you know? It seems a small thing, but hard to find at this price
I just release it most of the time
Video is sharp although I have not used it extensively yet
This is not for the professional photographer
for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
that u missed in the mirror!
When it went into full eclipse I touched the shutter button
I looked at various cameras with a mega zoom feature including the Canon SX50
it takes great pictures .
When I try to delete pictures on the memory card, I can't
And the pouch is a great way to protect and carry the camera andfilm film
Good value
I love the camera.
I guess I will have to post more as I learn and experiment with the camera
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
Use the USB cable to charge the battery in the camera,  4hrs, OR, get an extra charger and battery and do it that way, you HAVE A CHOICE with the s8100
* Short startup time (just about 1 sec) and no any noticeable shutter Lag
One point shy for not having rechargeable battery which isn't all that bad if you're traveling all you need is pop old ones amd replace a sinch
I was going to buy a Nikon s820
Blurry, blurry, blurry
The zoom is great -- I took pictures of the moon during the blood moon eclipse without using a tripod and loved the pictures I got
You need to invest in lenses which can be very costly, add to that having to carry around extra gear and swapping lenses on the fly
It is lightweight, small, takes fairly good photos, and looks cool, too
Sadly, I took most of the pictures with this camera, so I have a LOT of BLURRY pictures of monuments and pictures of people whose facial features are not clear at all
a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
Great camera takes good pictures
Images up to ISO1600 were pretty good for a 1/2
as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
The wi-fi and app are lame and all but useless
So I will just be carrying one camera now
Volume could be loader, so you can hear the stereo sound better
I have a hand tremor so normally have a great deal of difficulty getting decent pictures
I was just looking for a camera to take decent pics of the kids, and I wanted to stay within the $300 range
Edit- I was told wrong by the Nikon rep
Like all cameras, the most important component is the skill and imagination of the photographer
I'm a non-auto pretty much manual kind a photographer and don't like all the special things this kind of camera does
The biggest problem and most annoying is the door that holds the film in place opens at the slightest touch
The quality and ease are simply amazing
Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures.
There is also Av mode where the camera allows you to adjust the aperture of the lens while it handles the shutter speed
Perfect for carrying into the field
You wouldnt think it would get in the way, but i find my self often seeing the error "flash not fully raised" because my finger is blocking it
Give me a scroll wheel to go through images and setting and for God's sake give me a view finder
Its the best camera for the money and it takes beautiful pictures
it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
Very good budget camera, even in low light
i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
I just took it out of the box, charged the battery, and started taking pictures.
I need to experiment with it more, but so far very pleased
Battery life is good
Buy it and then let the fun begin
The photos it takes on its tiny,3x2 overpriced film are smeary,blurry, out of focus snaps with absolutely no value
Stay clear of the DMC FZ70 Panasonic camera and buy the Cannon
We stayed with Nikon because of past cameras
The LCD screen is one of the best I have ever seen and is of high quality
It comes loaded with goodies
I got this for my road trip, and it's fabulouuuusss
In love
The camera is not to heavy to carry all day
try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
I then looked at this camera
We were looking for a really good pics with a great auto mode and we narrowed our choices to the Nikon 8100, Sony HX5V, ZS5 and Canon SX210is
I suggest reading the manual and learning as much as you can about the settings it does have
I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it.
The EVF and LCD on the A3000 are too low rez by today 's standard, however, they are sufficient for the job
I'll post a picture of a football gamein normal view then in 60x view when I figure out how to addcustomer photos
The LCD screen is tough to use for manual focus and you cannot see anything sharply through the QVGA Tru-Finder - viewfinder at all, no matter how you adjust the dial
Perhaps that would happen with any camera though?I will keep using this camera and trying to learn how to maximize its capabilities
The pop-up flash can trigger the off-camera flash without problem
I was about 300 feet away from the stage, I just set the widest aperture it would let me at whatever zoom I had it, which was I think 4, ISO was between 400-800
I bought a Hoya Alfa MC UV and lens protector from Amazon in the 55mm size and it should protect the lens and not degrade the photos
The quality of the pictures are great
i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
One recommendation no matter which camera you buy,  get the fastest SDHC/XC card you can find
AMAZING CAMERA
After doing much research I picked this camera to replace my kodak easy share that I got in 2008
What I observed through the view screen was stunning
If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
I'm not a professional photographer and I'm on quite a learning curve at the moment; and totally thrilled to have a camera which does as much as this one does
It would be nice if the camera had a good battery that was rechargeable
My husband, the photographer, is enjoying learning how to use this camera after having used Panasonic cameras through the years
with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
(4) Image stabilization works really well, which I'm sure contributes to (3), but it also contributes to low shutter-speed far-zoomed-out pics as well
Easy to use Small to carry on
I highly recommend the Panasonic Lumix FZ70 for convenience and travel photography
This camera is so much fun
The focus peaking and zoom in assist make it a breeze to focus
It is easy to focus and just point and shoot
The camera  failed in ways that have been documented about the 280 elsewhere (see Amazon reviews and the Canon forums)
I bought my wife one after she lost her camera somewhere
Nothing I don't like about it, range is the best
Found it on Amazon for $199 with Amazon Prime 2 day shipping
(I posted some shots I took that day
Overall for the price I paid($279), this is unbeatable camera and easily matches the image quality of X A1 and it has comparable image quality to any camera under $1000
BRIGHT LIGHTWith daylight, images are beautiful and sharp
I had an earlier version and got familiar with the upgrade immediately
I'm hopefully optimistic
Summary: Video and still shooters--T5i is best, T5 is good
After a long research I think I did the BEST choice
So when the S8100 came along I decided to try it and am very glad that I did
(i can't help but play with the camera always)
It takes really clear pictures with nice color balance and tones
Zoom and Burst Shooting a Big Disappointment
I was greeted by a persistent and distracting screen flicker that I have not seen in any other camera
The manual that came with it is pretty basic
I hope this long winded review was of some help
This camera is everything I wanted
This camera worked great on my recent trip to the Butchart gardens in Victoria
no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
the shot looks perfect before you press the button but when it displays the photo taken, the light is so bright that the shot isn't any good and the photo does the same even when I decrease the exposure to the max
read the directions !
i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
I love the tilt-able/extendable screen for shooting overhead or waist high photos
This is a versitle camera and you can adjust the setting to take what ever kind of pictures you want
I was surprised the author was not more discerning
I am not going to write a lot about specs because they are fully listed at Panasonic's site but maybe I should note a few of the features that made me fall in love with this camera
love the speed and ease of the features and captures
It bounced around in my bag, got knocked off the table a time or two, and overall wasn't treated as well as it should have been
All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
Body is solid despite what some reviewers said
BUT it was easy as pie and I am snapping to my hearts content
The fast shooting takes some getting used to
It took a little playing to get it to connect with my iPad the first time, but wow, what a nice feature
It's the perfect sized travel camera for someone used to a bigger DSLR while having a comfortable, deep recessed, rubberized grip
I would recommend this camera to folks of all ages
this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
First digital camera
Takes nice, crisp photos with vivid color
It didn't have white balance meter, but still much more versatile than this thing
It took unbelievable pictures and the size
lovely camera
This is perfect for most photography that you will be doing, especially if you are looking into a less expensive model such as this
The S8100 is easy to use and the pictures are extraordinary
I finally used it for the first time at Maroon 5's NYE show in Vegas
Camera doesn't have a view finder but it makes up with tilt swivel screen in many direction so you can take pictures pointing above your head (if you're in crowd or if bright Sun is blaring in the middle of the day then you can Change screen position up, down or in sides
There are lots of options on the camera, but the instruction manual that comes packaged with it is totally useless, only shows you how to work the basic function to take pictures, so I had to experiment with the different settings to find what works best
but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
Yep, TRUE
The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
You will need to get a memory card to help with storage of pictures, but all in all a good and fun camera
This item had sold out, but then again it was about 2 weeks before the holiday
Some of the downsides are things that
1 MP and I can say less than $80 for this 20
You will not be dissapointed!
The have some great options that allow you to shoot 1mp at 120 fps, or 12mp at a decent rate
)Of course I love the 1080 video shooting, but it eats up alot of memory, so you will need a SDHC card or two
3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
Too early to fully rate this camera yet but a little dissatisfied
I've only had it for a week but I can see it being my best friend soon
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
It feels just wonderful in my hands as the grip is perfect even though my hands are small
I also looked at the newer model just out of curiousity
The camera intrigued me because it functions both as a digital and an instant print, and the prints are pretty good quality
I'm 6' tall and the palm grip doesn't strike me as overly diminutive so I can see myself carrying this around with out a strap and not experiencing hand cramps
when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
It is VERY noticeable and renders the beautiful looking video just about useless
Focus is generally fast and able to keep up, and the use of zoom does not cause a loud motor noise like it does in my old camera
I think I'd do more research on the SDHC Cards before I buy one
Bulky & poor quality prints
The experience was not the same as the 35 mm SLR cameras that I was used to
For this price, I cannot complain
I am impressed and cant wait to get more comfortable with it
(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
I went with the Nikon and couldn't be happier
fiance did n't like the feel .
as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
And I've played some with the video
The quailty of the printed picture is not decent at all
Otherwise fantastic camera
The lens protrudes a little, so this 'compact camera' is a bit bulkier (the lens also adds a bit of weight) than its peers, but for 10x zoom and the quality of pictures its a fair trade off
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
Other than that, for $160, you get a fully functioning 10 mp camera
im so disgusted and after reading nikon help center reviews I now know not to bother even calling
I got the red camera and I saw finger prints mine of course, but that does not bother me
It also rendered the camera entirely useless due to the inability to even sort through the functions of the camera to try and format the memory card while inserted in camera
picture were out of focus all the time; had to return it
Until then, I recommend you get one while the price remains well below $400 because I don't think it will stay their long when the word gets out how great this camera performs
otherwise this is one nice camera,  shooting at night from  a moving car thru the glass  really outstanding, settings more than enough, adjustable
I've gotten some great bird shots and compliments on a close up of the moon
I said, can your fancy camera do that?
exactly what it's purported to be
it is made of plastic .
That being said, let's look at the FZ70
For the price and quality, this camera is hard to beat
IMO this camera is as good as it gets for size, zoom range, and low light quality
i love all of the features , and presets as well .
It is easy to use and I would recommend it if you dont mind the size
I had a Canon Coolpix, but this is a new and upgraded version
In a room (without flash) the camera enhanced the color and brightness, to look like a picture that processed using Photoshop, In dark room it was much worst
Excellent Pictures
The adapter for these is always on the camera
They looked better than all of my friends pictures by far and they had way more expensive bulkier camera's than I did
It's a bit big and not very suited for travelling/For a well balanced camera with good quality and zoom, you may consider the following sony model
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
I was meeting up with friends in Guangdong so I had my wife buy another of the same model
I typically carry a Canon 40D and a 1DmkII but i wanted something smaller to carry around
and I don't shoot much video
However I did not want just any camera that used AA Battery power
I liked the sticker effect of the Polaroid, just wish it was better or a cheaper price
Easy to use and easy to transfer pictures to your PC
definetely a great camera .
I haven't got the hang of that yet, so I will have to read the book
Curious to see now if it will pull into focus these Drones in the NW skyline -
How can you beat that?Oh, and the color of the red camera is the most gorgeous shade of red I've ever seen
I have not yet figured out how to set aperture in manual mode so if anyone knows please comment
i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
I did actually purchased the camera
This was my fourth Panasonic Lumix camera - I have stepped up from one of the first Bridge cameras that they offered, and I loved them
I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality.
was a gift for teen  who just loves it
I concur with the majority of the pros I've seen in other reviews, but would offer a couple of cons that may be important to some potential buyers:- TOKEN GRIP: While I'm sure the grip on this camera is better than the one on its predecessors, it's still hardly a grip
If you buy this from a reputable brick and mortar camera dealer, they might actually let you immediately trade in the 18-55 and put it towards a nicer lens
my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
IT would be nice if you could set a zoom limit
On a bright note, the camera did take good indoor shots with nice color and flash distribution
Some of the picky reviews I read tells me these guys are clueless operators or have a malfunctioning unit (It happens to the best)I admit it took me some head-scratching to understand both of the photo programs that arrived in the camera box for loading into the computer
It's lightweight and easy to carry around, and the controls & setup are easy to navigate
Not only did the image stabilization take care of my tremors, it also took care of the rolling of the tour ship
I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested.
Its does really well in low light also
And for the most part, despite what DxoMark and others say about it, it excels at this task
The camera takes clean photos through ISO800, and still performs fairly decently through ISO3200
Nothing is free these days but this surely comes close
They won't last
All the different features are wonderful
Although it has a lot of neat features, it didn't deliver on true color quality, especially indoors, moving or fairly still pets, or outdoors in my rose garden (which was surprising, since it did much better on closeups of the roses)
Not only will the price be better, but you might find the earlier model still has all the features you want
Ideal camera for sophisticated shutterbug
However, this was my first camera without a viewfinder, and after two weeks, I returned it and ordered the Panasonic Lumix FZ60 - a more expensive camera; but, with viewfinder
A great point and shoot
Great for pictures as well as for taking movies on the fly
The choice is between being a BIRDER, that is, using binoculars to look at birds, and being a BIRD PHOTOGRAPHER, more interested in the great photo than spotting everything
Zoom works great and is able to focus quickly
In looking at the specs on the L830, it looked like just the right thing to replace the P100
I am sure I would have been content with the Canon but I love this Nikon
And at this low price your getting into the Sony E-mount lens system, and can always upgrade the body later
I took about 1200 photos on that trip without a hitch
A new powerful 30x optical zoom lens with an Optical Image Stabilization, which spans an incredible 25-750mm equivalent range in a pocket-sized body, is a significant improvement over the SX280's 20x range
but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
This camera replaced an S8000 I got a little more than a year ago that has most of the identical features and it took great photos too until the lens wouldn't retract with the same "Lens Error" message
It will not take pictures, &#34;Lens Error&#34; comes up whenever I turn it on
the prints are beautiful !
Bought the Transcend 32GB SDHC
switches are poorly assembled and the chrome ring around the lens feel of prior to use
1 MP Olympus hands down
You can blow up your pictures on the screen much larger
Finally, some people complained about background noise while recording video at 1080p
I have taken very good care of this camera
I added a memory card and can switch from internal to external memory depending on my memory needs
It wasn't as it was described
The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
I just got back from taking pics at my daughter's Christmas program and all of my other cameras I've had there's no way I could get a good close-up shot, they would always be blurry
I took closeups at a ballgame and razor sharp without a tripod
canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
(the A58 does NOT use the FW50 battery)
This is a great camera for the price and it take great pictures
The three negative criticisms I have are that it saves RAW images as RW2
But the pictures are just as good as always
Works for a basic need
On the other side of the ledger, with the flexibility of interchangeable lenses and the features of LCD and EVF, for me potentially it could be a step above most comparable P&S; competition, with the caveat the prospective buyer has to understand exactly what they are getting since in auto mode specifically, I don&#8217;t believe definitively superior Image quality will be realized
It is like a car with automatic tranny that has a handle looking like standard shifter
I dont mind how the flash needs to pop up, it was an easy adjustment to make
looks more sturdy and easy to hold on hand than SX519
However, after having been using it often and seeing such wonderful results, I am very satisfied and happy
it has great wide angle at the other end
I will update this review as I gain more experience with the video and special functions (which there are many) in the future
In my case, flash comes up whenever there is not enough light unless I turn it off
Purchased camera for Christmas
SO in the end, would I buy again?
I still have lots more testing to do in this area however
i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
Nikon Coolpix S8100
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
What I like about A3000 is the hefty grip to hold it
The SD card slot is a plus
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
For example the Panasonic GF3 is often on sale, and in particular with the fantastic 14MM or 20MM pancake lens would give better image quality
I bought this camera because of the large APS-C 20 MP sensor, but the 12MP sensor in the Canon T3 renders a better image
Sent to Nikon and I'm still waiting after a month in their shop
We were at the Niagara Falls and even the evening pictures of the Falls turned out great, I was surprised
I will say that if you don't care about the high powered zoom and burst shooting, this may be a good camera for you, but if those features are important keep looking
We ordered this after seeing it featured on a local tv station's &#34;Tech Check
I did have to employ bracing techniques, holding breath, gently pressing shutter and using any railing I could find to lean up against, but no tripod or mono pod
0-Inch LCD (Black)Great features and amazing flexibility
and I'd be tempted to pay that much
What complicates matters is that the Canon Rebel SL1 is in the same neighborhood price wise and comes with the better 18-55 STM lens, better LCD (though not that much better), better burst performance and is in a more compact body
Met all my expectations and more, even impressed my friend that such a small camera could take such nice pictures and be so versatile
Positives:
The only way to see your movie in High definition is to burn it into a Blueray DVD (expensive option)
The LCD screen is amazing
This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
5 star rating for this product, IMHO
Tough to beat
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
I was let in at the AMA and People's Choice Awards but was told not to use it
Gives instant photo reference to add to journals for art, travel,  and scrapbooking
This is a great camera
I really do like it
I've taken a ton of video with this camera, and it is always impressive
Five Stars
I Love My Sony
The flash is a little overpowering so thought I'd put a screen on it
Two cameras ago I had a Nikon coolpix that was a very good camera (this was about 6-7 years ago)
I've had it for a year
The lens that comes with this camera is ok but it's lowest f-stop is 5 and that is bad in low light situations
not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
The display is great (or so I am told since I can't really see it)
We love this camera
I've purchased two of these cameras for gifts and the recipients were delighted
The A3000 is far more pedestrian and clearly targets the amateur upgrading from a point and shoot camera and seeking the picture quality improvements of an SLR
Excellent for the price
I'm not an uber-photographer but I know my way around point/shoot cameras
CNET unfortunately is greatly underrating this camera in its editorial review.
i love it
Another unfortunate feature is that the proprietary charging cable is lost (as in my case), there doesn't seem to be an easy way to get one - I imagine I will have to call Polaroid because the cable is not available on Amazon or the Polaroid website
Unbeatable for dollar spent
4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
So far I have taken a few hundred photos an I am more than pleased with the results
It is not as small as my last camera but definitely more compact than my first
it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
In good light, this camera takes very nice pictures
The camera overall is great in the fact you don't need different zoom lenses and it works much like the small camera versions only with a little more bells and whistles
Battery life fair
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
Great camera
you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
You just need to hold it differently than other cameras for the flash to pop up on the top left side, one handed pics (for right handers), no problem
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
It's a little bulky, but mainly because of the 1200mm zoom capability
do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
this camera will stay with me for years !
Disappointing
The paper prints so well that it looks old-fashioned still
Disappointed
I will informed all my family and my friends, so they will get one
Feels good
I should have practiced more before leaving home
The camera comes with a link for some application that you can import/view your images with, but I don't want unneeded software taking up space
DSCX-HX5V - which I LOVE
The camera is small, light weight and easy to handle, and fits well into my hand
This offers two fully automatic modes ("intelligent Auto" and "Superior Auto", two traditional priority modes (aperture and shutter), a scene selection mode, a panoramic shooting mode and a full manual mode
June 14, 2014I took this camera on a month long vacation and took about 250 photos using all the program settings
It has many advanced features for a compact, such as the ability to view a histogram and to look at the information of pictures you've already taken, like the ISO sensitivity used
If you don't do video AT ALL, the T3 is cheaper still, and has more battery life and is an ounce lighter
I wanted a simple but good quality picture taking camera
I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
Great little camera
Don't get me wrong--this is no high end DSLR camera
Canon puts in software to make a virtual wi-fi connection with your cell phone so you can move pictures for sharing on social networks
The only down side I think it feals a little fragile
Recently swapped my much heavier Nikon D90 for the much lighter Sony A3000, since owning this new camera my interest in photography has gone through the roof
Up close, midway, or far out, it handles it all and with amazing clarity
The continuous shooting is not as good as my DSLR, but still very acceptable
A little bigger and heavier than I expected
I now have to go and spend more of my money on a SD card reader so I can easily transfer photos
i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
DON'T BUY ONE
OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
And the price is ridiculously low right now, I notice
In particular, portraits of my family and pictures of my dog were clear and crisp
This camera exceeded all of my expectations
It also features a built-in flash and hot shoe housing
"meh" interface
took it to Christmas brunch and now on our way to dinner
4- Looks great.
It does have good battery life, as I was not able to deplete the battery on a 3-day trip with probably 100+ photos taken
EDIT: 1-13-2011We took our camera to the colts/jets playoff game and got some great video before the game and some great pictures
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
Features are great but would rather have fewer features but better photos and videos
I suspect they have a backlog on the the part as this appears to be a common problem
It is bulky to use and the pictures all come out with a yellow hue to them
It took great photographs
WORKS LIKE A CHARM
I have used this camera for 4 months, taken it on 4 trips - 1 beach, 1 cruise, 1 city, 1 nature/camping
This camera is so easy to use!
Update: September 25, 2013:  I am even more impressed now with this camera and its IQ (image quality) and its features
I'm sending this back
Image quality is very good IMO
did not give it 5 stars because it does not include case
I highly recommend this camera
The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
It is only a little bit inconvenient that in order to review your pictures you have to move over the little slider to the playback option, much like older cameras, rather than a playback button - but that's just a minor complaint
While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
Excellent Battery Life Good Value
for the FZ-70 that was 1200 plus the digital zoom
I can't give it a full 5 stars since the battery life could be better
They absolutely love it
The camera itself is ok, again, just ok
It takes excellent photos, easy to use, great zoom, and fast
At this price point, I feel as though I've paid for an excellent image sensor and the basic means by which to get light there
I do really love this camera
But the grip bars on the front of this model help
This camera is extremely user-friendly, the battery life is great, and the photo quality, pretty darn good
Since I was not going to be using this for videos, I decided to try it
My sister is not an accomplished photographer at all, but she found this camera at a local camera store and took it on our trip to Tanzania in February
I give this 4 stars because it is a bit bulky, the materials feel pretty cheap and it feels a bit like a toy camera
despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
But it is NOT the camera's fault, and the more I use this camera and the more I read the CD manual, the more I love it
Got great pics with the zoom
Minor cosmetic flaw that does not affect the performance of this great digi cam
I really loved the camera
